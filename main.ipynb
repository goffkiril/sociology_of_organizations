       "'as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 2 our purpose & vision lse opened its doors in 1895 with three rooms and 200 students, the majority of whom studied part-time in evening classes. in 1919, william beveridge led a period of rapid intellectual and physical deve lopment for the school, and a century later lse looks very different. as we now share this strategy and vision for the future, we are building from a global reputation for excellence in teaching, research, and public engagement in the social sciences. we have a transformed campus, and 11,000 core residential students with 40,000 more through our extended programming. nonetheless, wide consultation with staff, students, alumni and friends of lse has confirmed an unequivocal ongoing commitment to the original vision for lse as: a community of people and ideas, founded to know the causes of things, for the betterment of society . as the world around us changes, we need to work harder than ever to help shape the world’s political, economic and social future for the better. lse’s brand is globally respected and a powerful draw for students, staff and partners. building on this, our vision for lse 2030 sets ourselves a challenging level of ambition in leveraging lse’s considerable expertise to ensure that - through our research, through the graduates we shape, and through our collaborations locally, nationally and globally - we are: the leading social science institution with the greatest global impact. our guiding principles excellence built from diversity and inclusion lse’s outstanding strength is the international diversity of its staff and students, drawing on talents and perspectives from all places and all backgrounds. all that we do will reflect the importance we place on equity, diversity and inclusion, ensuring that lse is a stimulating and supportive environm ent for work and study, and recognised as a place for serious debate where diverse viewpoints are respectfully but rigorously contested. higher education is experiencing unprecedented change in policy, regulation, funding and competition, whilst also needing to respond to political instability, changing labour markets and careers. in steering a course through turbulent times, lse will maintain a clear focus on quality rather than quantity. we will maintain our distinctiveness as a specialist and world-leading social sciences institution, striving always for excellence in both education and research, and robustly evaluating our own practices to ensure a culture of continuous improvement. we will broaden access to an lse education through an expanded programme of education and skills for life, including summer schools, executive education, blended and online opportunities, and will not seek to grow our resident student population above 12,000 full time students. faculty quality is key to delivering excellence in education and research. we will continue to invest time, effort and resources into recruiting, developing, supporting and retaining outstanding faculty from across the globe, and we will do so with a particular focus on diversifying the composition of our faculty. global impact and reach lse already has an exceptional international presence, with 70% of our students and 46% of our staff coming from over 200 countries outside the uk, an unrivalled global network of 145,000 alumni, over 1,500 institutional research collaborators and more than 3 million downloads of our research worldwide during 2017/18, more than any other russell group university. but we can, and we will, do more to enable wider access to an lse education, to reach further and inspire more people through our research, and to deliver meaningful benefit to individuals and communities in all parts of the world. ensuring a sustainable future the world faces unprecedented challenges to sustainable development, such as climate change, inequality, and political and social tensions. lse will continue to work tirelessly to address these challenges through research, education, public engagement and our own campus operations. lse has a proud history of defending intellectual freedom and upholding the standards of rigorous and informed debate. in this age where the value of higher education and experts in general is being called into question, and where opinions are being formed on the basis of rhetoric rather than evidence, lse will lead the way in upholding the rigorous standards of evidence-informed analysis and debate, and securing the future of social sciences. considerable uncertainty also surrounds the future economics of higher education, with constraints on core funding streams, rising costs and tougher competition for staff and students . our financial plan and funding principles together provide a robust and transparent framework within which we make informed choices about how we use our financial resources. through this framework, we will ensure a financially sustainable future for lse by broadening and expanding our educational offer and exploring new opportunities through research, entrepreneurship and digital innovation. philanthropy will be integral to our efforts, as it has been since our founding, and the visionary support and generosity of alumni and friends continues to enhance every aspect of lse life. as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 3 priority 1: lse education for global impact an lse education is valued for its intellectual rigour and global outlook. our students thrive in an international, research-rich culture, where excellence is built from diversity and respectful challenge. in a rapidly changing world, our educational offer must also evolve with frequently refreshed curriculum, varied modes of learning and assessment, and opportunities for our students to debate, innovate and create. as our first strategic priority, we commit to listening to student voices and feedback through student surveys, and working closely in partnership with students, to develop an educational offer for 2030 and beyond and ensure a more consistently excellent student experience. 1.1 education for 2030 and beyond lse students will have agency in their own learning, charting a personal trajectory through a diverse range of courses and assessments, while building a coherent, holistic picture of their disciplines(s). we will involve lse students with the school’s outstanding research culture, through embedding enquiry-based learning and research practice at all levels of the curriculum including through the effective application of cuttingedge digital technologies. we will enhance and expand the innovative lse 100 programme to enable lse undergraduates to work as critical investigators in interdisciplinary teams to tackle complex social questions. we will challenge lse students to develop their ethical awareness, to learn to persuade and not to silence, and to engage in robust but respectful debate with diverse views. we expect lse students to act with integrity and learn to reflect critically on their own biases. we will provide our faculty with the support and advice required to become and remain excellent educators and we will recognise, celebrate and reward excellence in education. 1.2 students as agents of change we will ensure lse students have opportunities to innovate and drive meaningful change within the school through the flagship lse change makers programme, delivered in partnership with lse students’ union. we will support lse students to create and produce diverse outputs, showcase their learning externally, develop skill in engaging with communities, and be recognised for what they contribute to the world even as they study. we will equip lse students to develop successful careers, graduating with the analytical skills, digital fluency, cultural awareness and entrepreneurial confidence to recognise opportunities and lead change for the betterment of society in their diverse communities and professions. 1.3 an inclusive student experience we will celebrate the exceptional diversity of our student community, and will ensure this diversity is reflected in a n inclusive curriculum that recognises a variety of perspectives, experiences and cultural norms. we will foster a strong sense of community and belonging by connecting students across cohorts and departments, through mentor schemes, peer study groups, student societies and events, and common rooms in every department, to ensure that all students feel that they are valued members of our scholarly community. we will provide holistic and comprehensive support for every student, with c onsistently excellent student services and a focus on student wellbeing. we particularly recognise the importance of a student’s early experiences at university for their long term success, and will curate a student-centred induction experience, including a place for every first year student in an lse residence. we will continue to build on our sector-leading efforts to widen access from across the uk as well as globally, to ensure the best students can benefit from an lse education at all levels, regardless of their means or background. we will significantly increase financial and other support for students and work in partnership with other institutions to better understand and effectively address systemic inequalities and differential attainment. 1.4 education and skills for life we will expand our educational offer to support our alumni and other professionals in refreshing and adapting their knowledge and skills as needed through evolving careers. whether taking the first steps after graduation, developing a career, leading a business or enjoying retirement, we will offer a continuum of ongoing learning opportunities in the form of short courses, summer schools and executive education programmes that enable our wider community to keep returning to lse - physically and remotely - throughout their lives. as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 4 priority 2: lse research for the world lse is unique in its dedication to the social sciences. the school has a reputation for being international, interdisciplinary, issue-oriented and pioneering in the development of new methodologies and disciplines , and our researchers are world-leading thinkers on critical issues, in keeping with our founding purpose of knowing the causes of things for the betterment of society. in ref 2014, 98% of lse research submitted across 14 units of assessment was judged to be world-leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). today the social sciences and evidence-informed expertise are needed more than ever to understand how the world is changing, and the effects of rapid technological developments, challenges to our economic and political systems, and social concerns such as ageing and wellbeing. as our second strategic priority, we commit to building on our research strengths to take a leading role in securing and shaping the future of social sciences, by robustly evaluating and articulating the value of our disciplines, developing the next generation of thought-leaders, deepening and broadening our real-world impact, and convening influential people across different sectors to tackle complex issues. 2.1 world-class research in the social sciences we will maintain our position as the leading specialist social sciences institution and continue to invest in a broad disciplinary base and vibrant research environment across and between all departments to enable diverse research activity. we will provide our faculty with the funding, support and career development guidance required to become and remain internationally renowned researchers who create world-leading publications and impact. we will also build on the success of the lse beveridge 2.0 commission to champion and curate cross-cutting research themes aligned to the un’s sustainable development goals. we will bring together academics, students, alumni, practitioners, partners and the wider public to focus on key social and economic issues at the local, national and global levels, including: health & wellbeing; social cohesion & prosperity; cities & communities; climate & sustainability; firms, markets & economies; governance, justice & democracies; and technology, innovation & entrepreneurship. we will support and promote these themes through the annual lse f estival, philanthropic contributions, targeted incentives and support for impact and public engagement activities. we will strengthen our focus on developing the social scientists of the future, by enhancing phd training across the school, growing our phd cohort with an emphasis on diversity, and increasing the number of studentships and associated financial support. we will develop a stronger and integrated framework of support for postdoctoral and early career researchers, including enhanced access funding. 2.2 lead and sustain the social sciences we will continue to demonstrate and advocate for the value of social sciences, and work to ensure our disciplines are appropriately recognised,

convening and engaging leading researchers from across the world, actively championing diversity and inclusion of different voices and viewpoints , and upholding the highest standards of rigorous enquiry. in the face of serious challenge to the research environment through our changing relationship with europe and the uncertain future of national funding, we will work to secure sustainable funding for social sciences research by diversifying our income. we will do this through strengthening a culture of fundraising, enhancing support for external grant-raising, and growing our research commercialisation and consultancy activities. 2.3 shape the world’s political, economic and social future we will work in partnership to deepen and broaden lse’s impact and contribution to the betterment of society, connecting international interests and relationships around the world through issue-oriented research and evidencebased interventions. we will review and refresh our strategic partnerships, building on the strength of our presence in london, connections with government and policy-makers, alumni networks and institutional partnerships with prestigious universities around the

through branches, joint ventures and off shore campuses - of universities and business schools. the number of international students – i.e. students enrolled in a university outside of their country of origin - has significantly increased during the last twenty years (from 2 million in 1998 to over 5.3 million in 2017). international student exchanges, double degrees and international partnerships in general among higher education institutions have literally boomed during the last two decades, with asian students playing a significant role in the growth of the international flow of students across the globe. similarly, the number of faculty and researchers working abroad has grown significantly, together with international cooperation among researchers of different countries. these two major trends are likely to be affected in opposite ways by the emergency crisis generated by the pandemic that spread across the entire world in 2020. while the use of digital technologies for teaching and learning has experienced an exponential growth during the crisis and the role of science and interdisciplinary research has become even more important in the interaction between science and politics during the covid pandemic, the globalization of the higher education industry has suffered a sudden dropoff, mostly due to the constraints on international travel and mobility. indeed, while digital platforms have experienced a boom and a large part of the developed world has moved from a traditional physical face to face educational model to an online one, the international flow of students has suffered a major drawback, with most foreign students returning to their home countries and international study abroad experiences being temporarily suspended due to the risk of cross border contagion. while it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve in the future, it is reasonable to assume that these two opposite effects will not merely last for a few months, but will rather affect the evolution of higher education in the next few years. indeed, the sudden acceleration of online educational activities is likely to continue affecting universities and business schools worldwide. similarly, the slowdown in the globalization of the industry is also likely to have some long lasting effects. in addition to the above mentioned effects, the health crisis generated by the covid 19 pandemic is likely to lead to some additional important consequences, that will also affect the higher education industry: a global recession that will reduce job opportunities in the most severely hit industries, such as tourism, entertainment, hospitality, automotive; a reduction in the international mobility of people and goods, which will impact global trade and the global manufacturing platforms of production; a significant increase of debt - both in the public and private sector - as a consequence of the economic downturn, with leverage increasing in all economic segments, i.e. households, corporates and governments; a significant increase in the role and weight of the public sector in most advanced market economies, where the possibility of overcoming the financial difficulties suffered by households and private firms, especially smes, has only been possible thanks to government intervention. over 5.3 million international students 98 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025these phenomena have clear implications for the higher education industry, both in its teaching and research activities. they include, but are not limited to: understanding the future challenges and opportunities for a european institution with global ambitions like bocconi university requires us to carefully examine the above mentioned implications, together with the more general scenario that lies ahead. in the following sections we analyze: (i) the future economic and demographic scenario, (ii) the major trends, challenges and opportunities affecting the job market for graduates, and (iii) the main trends affecting the higher education industry. a more specific analysis of the main strengths and weaknesses of bocconi, in light of the above mentioned trends and challenges, is then presented in section (iv). the main strategic goals that will drive the university’s activities in the next decade (2021-2030) are presented in section (v). finally, the five-year plan related to the period from 2021 to 2025 is presented, with a detailed analysis of the objectives to be achieved during this challenging period. the analysis presented in this document has significantly benefited from individual interviews to the members of the international advisory committee (iac) of bocconi university and from discussions with the members of the board of directors. also, the results of an open survey to the entire faculty has provided significant contributions, together with individual colloquia with the school deans, the department directors and key members of the administrative staff. finally, important input has also been provided by the bocconi alumni community and by the students’ representatives. this wide ranging and deep consultation exercise enabled the consolidate and strengthening of the main results and conclusions of this analysis. the reduction in revenues (student intake, fundraising, executive education) and increase in costs (health and safety, technology); the decrease in the international mobility of talented international students and professors; problems related to the supply of internships and placement opportunities for students and graduates; the potential reduction in state funding given the budget constraints that will likely be faced by local and national governments; the emergence of new issues and challenges for the world economy to be addressed by rigorous research; problems related to class size and, more generally, the teaching and learning model given the physical distance constraints; an increased need of scholarships and financial aid for students whose families are facing economic and financial problems. 1110 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025scenario analysis part 1 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025the demographic and economic scenario in this section we briefly examine the demographic and economic scenario of the next decade. this is relevant not only to understand how the market for higher education will evolve globally, but also to better identify the major trends that will affect the demand for tertiary education in the different macro regions of the world. in doing so, a number of projections by eurostat, the un, the world bank and other sources have been used. while most of these projections and estimates were formulated before the 2020 covid 19 pandemic crisis, it is reasonable to assume that they still hold, especially as far as demographics in europe, america and asia are concerned. figure 1 | european union population projection 1. based on this analysis, a number of important evidences have been identified. first, despite the low fertility rate in a number of countries of the old continent, the eu (27 countries + uk) population is expected to continue to grow in the next two decades. the low fertility rate of some countries, including italy, will negatively affect population dynamics only starting from 2040 (figure 1). 2018 2020 2030 2040 2050 2070 2070 2080 2090 2100 millions 530 525 520 515 510 505 500 495 490 485 480 475 projections 2100: european union - 27 countries + uk projections 2100: european union - 27 countries + uk source: eurostat, 2019 1514 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025within the eu, there are significant cross country differences in the age distribution of the population and, as a consequence, of its future evolution. as an example, italy, the third largest country by population after germany and france, with a fertility rate of 1.29 per woman, has an age distribution of its population with a very low percentage of young people (figure 2). as a comparison, the age distribution of the french population has a clearly different shape, with a much higher share of young figure 2 | age distribution of the italian and french population 1 2 3 40milions 5 85 years or over 80 -

9 years less than 5 years people, partly derived by a much higher fertility rate, at 1.93. the italian population, and especially the share of those in higher education, is therefore expected to decline during the next decade. also, it is important to highlight that italy has a low share of population attaining tertiary education (27% among 25-34 age group), second to last in the eu (oec average 43% among 25-34 age group). this has clear implications for a university like bocconi, where the majority of the students are of italian nationality. 1 2 3 40milions 5 85 years or over 80 -

therefore reasonable to assume that the total number of higher education students will significantly expand during the next decade. figure 5 | evolution of the size of the world middle class, 1950-2030 (billions) source: author\\'s calculations source: brookings institution, working paper on global economy and development 2017 defined as those households with per capita incomes between $10 and $100 per person per day (pppd) in 2005 ppp terms (kharas, 2010; world bank, 2007; ernst & young, 2013; bank of america merrill lynch, 2016). this implies an annual income for a four-person middle-class household of $14,600 to $146,000 however, when looking at the distribution of the world middle class by macro regions, one can see that the share represented by asia increases from 54% in 2020 to 65% in 2030 in terms of numbers, and from 43% in 2020 to 57% in 2030 in terms of spending. there is therefore a parallel shift towards asia not only in terms of population dynamics, but also in terms of spending power (table 1). similarly, the bottom panel of table 1 shows the expected change in the world top countries in terms of middle class consumption. note that italy does not appear in the top 10 in 2020 and france will not appear in this group in 2030. china and india will represent together almost 40% of total middle class world consumption in 2030. while these forecasts were formulated before the 2020 pandemic crisis, it is reasonable to assume that these trends will not be significantly affected. table 1 | middle class evolution by macro region number and share of global

2030 & strategic plan 2025fourth, an analysis of the allocation of middle class spending shows that education represents one of the items where spending is expected to increase the most (or decrease less) in the next decade, especially in the growing global cities, i.e. the global cities that are expected to grow the most in the next decade (figure 6). figure 6 | changes in middle class spending allocation - 2020 to 2030 source: global middle class consumption study, 2017 . visa business and economics insights, oxford economics finally, it is important to highlight that, despite the decreasing weight of italy in terms of population and economic weight, milano is generally classified among the top global cities (see figure 7), thanks to its competitive position in some key industries (fashion, food, finance, healthcare, pharma, etc.) and to its attractiveness for young people from all over the world. although currently severely threatened by the 2020 pandemic crisis that hit so severely milano and the lombardy region, this competitive position represents a key competitive factor in the attractiveness for students and faculty members from all over the world. figure 7 | selected global cities and income segment composition to sum up, it is reasonable to conjecture that the higher education industry is expected to grow significantly in terms of demand during the next decade. this increase is related both to an increase in the number of people in the right age bracket and in the share of global spending in higher education. this increase will mostly come from asian students, who will grow both in numbers and in terms of purchasing power. in this context, italy shows a declining population, a low share of population below 25 years of age, and a lower share of population attaining tertiary education than the european average. however, milan, the country’s economic and financial capital, where bocconi is located, while threatened by the recent pandemic crisis, represents a dynamic and attractive location well positioned among the top global cities of the world. -15% food alcohol clothes housing house goods health transport communication

market : trends, challenges and opportunities 2. in this section we present a brief analysis of the major features and trends that are likely to affect the job market for graduates in the next decade. this analysis has benefited from interviews with members of the international advisory council, members of the board of directors and a number of hr managers from major corporates and financial institutions. the main trends characterizing the future job market are summarized below. first, during the last few years a growing skills mismatch between supply and demand has been recorded. this mismatch is mostly due to the shortage of competences in areas such as computer science, data science, information technology, and more generally science. these are often related to the more general stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) competences. it is reasonable to assume that this skills mismatch will continue to characterize the future years and will even be worsened by the digital practices and needs that emerged during the 2020 covid 19 pandemic. furthermore, this trend towards a growing demand of digital, data and tech competences is also favored by the increasing degree of automation, which is expected to displace routine jobs and create new jobs, particularly in the area of stem. indeed, as highlighted by the oecd, the changes in skills demand brought about by digitalization create opportunities for some workers while making others more vulnerable. highly skilled workers are more likely to benefit as their skills complement technology, they can perform non-routine tasks, and tend to have better access to training opportunities than the lower skilled. conversely, those with low levels of skills are more likely to be employed in jobs that are vulnerable to automation and also face increasing competition from middle-skilled workers whose jobs have been most affected by the digital transformation. according to the oecd, the intensity of skills shortages and surpluses has worsened in the last decade, calling into question the adaptability of individuals and economies in responding to changing skills needs. 2524 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025figure 8 | most difficult professional roles to recruit data scientist data analyst business intelligence specialist it consultant data analyst - research sales manager business controller digital marketing manager project manager - business strategy project manager - it 14% 13% 12% 11% 9% 7% 6% 6% 6% 6% a survey recently conducted by bocconi with 188 human resource managers representing major corporates and institutions has identified the positions that are perceived as most difficult to fill. these include roles that require specific competences such as technical/it, quantitative, digital and computer science skills. the results of this survey, reported in figure 8 below, are consistent with the above mentioned skills mismatch. indeed, the positions where the shortage of graduates appears most significant include data scientists, data analysts, business intelligence specialists and it consultants. a similar evidence emerges from an analysis conducted by the world economic forum concerning the redundant and new professional roles, as reported in table 2. as can be seen, among the new roles a number of them relate to the above mentioned digital, data and technological skills. it is important to highlight that digital, data science and information technology competences are sought not only for it-related profiles, but more generally for managerial positions within corporates, consulting firms and the financial services industry. indeed, in the above mentioned survey conducted by bocconi with a large number of hr managers, digital, data and it competencies appear as the top three most demanded competences, followed by flexibility, adaptability and analytical skills. source: atlas/work, bocconi university, 2019. 2726 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025source: world economic forum, 2019. note: roles marked with * appear across multiple columns. this reflects the fact that they might be seeing stable or declining demand across one industry but be in demand in another. based on the above, one can conclude that a new workforce is emerging in the job market, featuring a new set of knowledge and competences. data analysts and scientists, ai and machine-learning specialists, digital transformation and new technologies specialists are likely to arise amongst the new roles in the job market. once again, the need for this new workforce will even be increased by the crisis experienced by most companies during the 2020 pandemic. at the same time, “human touch” jobs and customer-related professions keep being relevant for corporates (customer service, sales and marketing professionals, people management, innovation managers). on the opposite front, routine-based, middleskilled white-collar jobs are expected to become redundant and to be automated. this scheme is mirrored in the set of skills sought: some are deeply connected with the technological change in the market (advanced it, programming, digital and data analytics skills), some are more related to “human” complex abilities and aptitudes (critical thinking, communication and negotiation, entrepreneurship and innovation, resilience and flexibility). second, given the rapidly changing job profiles and the high degree of uncertainty concerning future job requirements, future graduates will need to be equipped with a stronger ability for adaptability, resilience and a commitment to continuous learning. transversal cognitive skills, such as critical thinking, complex problem solving, creative thinking, “learning to learn” are also considered key not only to respond to future challenges, but also to help graduates shape a better future for all. table 3 | evolving skills demand (2018-2022) today, 2018 • analytical thinking and innovation • complex

forum survey concerning the evolution of the required skills in the future. reasoning, problem solving, critical thinking and analytical thinking clearly appear, together with technology design and programming, leadership and emotional intelligence, among the future required skills. an additional important skill that is often overlooked in continental european universities is represented by debating skills, often reflected in anglosaxon universities in the presence of so called “debating societies”. 2928 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025a third important trend in the job market is related to the growing emphasis on the so called 21st century skills. in addition to digital literacy, these include soft skills such as creativity, the ability to adapt to change, resilience, interpersonal skills, entrepreneurship, and intellectual curiosity. all these skills are increasingly mentioned by hr managers as key skills required by graduates entering the job market in the future and are indicated by the oecd as the subject of a growing skills gap. fourth, a growing need of interdisciplinary studies to address increased complexity of the business world is generally perceived by hr managers as a key feature of the education of future managers and business leaders. this trend is likely to be strengthened by the recent pandemic crisis. indeed, it has become increasingly clear that the collaboration among different disciplines and areas of expertise (e.g. medicine, mathematics and computer science; economics, sociology and statistics; etc.) provides significant value added in dealing with emergencies such as the one generated by the covid 19 pandemic2. finally, social and emotional skills, including empathy, self-awareness, respect for others, and the ability to communicate are likely going to increase in relevance in light of the fact that workplaces are becoming more ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse. these skills are considered to be key to fostering more inclusive, fair, tolerant and sustainable economies and societies. for executives, teamwork and team leadership skills, the ability to inspire and lead teams through change, and emotional intelligence are always in high demand according to the oecd “skills for jobs” survey. 2 an example of response to this need of interdisciplinary studies is represented by the “covid crisis lab” recently introduced by bocconi, where epidemiologists, economists, sociologists, computer scientists and experts of artificial intelligence cooperate to address the problems raised by the covid 19 crisis. the above mentioned job market trends have clear implications for higher education institutions. first, it is important to strengthen the computer science, data science and more generally digital content of the programs offered to students of the different degrees. this would not only allow graduates to be more competitive in the job market, but also to reduce the above mentioned shortage of technical competences and skills mismatch. second, universities should find ways to improve the set of soft skills that are so much demanded by corporates and institutions, especially as far as managerial and leadership positions are concerned. this could be done by embedding soft skills in curricula that are focused primarily on technical aspects, and by fostering transversal competencies that are essential to leverage technical skills, including effective communication, teamwork/collaboration, and leadership. third, teaching and learning methodologies should be aimed at improving graduates’ cognitive skills such as critical thinking, complex problem solving, and creative thinking. finally, universities should foster interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in their curricula by favoring connections between specialized subject areas, fostering thematic learning, combining related subjects, and supporting project-based learning. 3130 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025the competitive landscape: trends, challenges and opportunities 3. this section presents an analysis of the competitive scenario of the higher education industry and of its main trends, challenges and opportunities. more specifically, the major trends affecting demand and supply are first examined. in this analysis, a number of relevant questions are also addressed. (i) what factors affect the international competitiveness of universities? (ii) what internationalization strategies do they adopt? (iii) how is technological innovation affecting the academic world? (iv) who are the new competitors? (v) what major trends are likely to affect demand and supply in the future? an analysis of the consequences and implications of the major trends affecting the higher education industry is then presented. 3332 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20253.1. | the main trends affecting the demand for higher education during the last two decades the higher education industry has become increasingly global, with students becoming more and more internationally mobile and universities expanding globally through foreign branches, joint ventures, partnerships and off-shore campuses. on the demand side, international students, i.e. students attending universities located in a foreign country, have increased from approximately 2 million in 1998 to over 5.3 million in 2017 (figure 9). figure 9 | international students 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 millions of students 5.5 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 total, 5.3 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2017

mobility of students is played by the competitiveness of different countries. indeed, universities do not “walk alone” in the competitive arena, as they are strictly linked to the country in which they have their headquarters. this is not only due to the legal and regulatory framework, but also to the global reputation and future growth perspectives. empirical evidence from a recent report by bocconi university (atlas/work, 2019) on the international mobility of university students shows that the us remains the most attractive destination in terms of total number of international students enrolled, followed by the uk, australia, france and germany. canada and china appear as the rising stars and are consolidating their positions. as for the share of international students, the most internationally open system is new zealand, followed by the uk, switzerland and australia. in europe, also denmark and the netherlands reach a double-digit share of international students over the total student population, followed by france and germany. italy is still lagging behind, attracting the majority of international students from non-oecd countries, while the majority of outgoing students moves towards oecd countries. the subjects most affected by international mobility of students are the ones belonging to the stem area, business administration and law. 3534 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025figure 10 | top 15 european countries for positive net flow of students source: bocconi, atlas/work, 2019. 100000 200000 300000 3500000 400000 united kingdom france germany

international flow of university students (incoming students - outgoing students). the evidence confirms the above mentioned leadership of the uk, followed by france, germany and the netherlands. italy, ranked 11th, is not even in the top ten european countries in terms of international students’ attractiveness. many factors affect student mobility at the country level. a strong national job market, with the presence of global multinational companies, represents a powerful driving force of a country\\'s appeal. notably, france enjoys an \"attractiveness bonus\" that goes beyond its current international attractiveness, job market\\'s strengths and quality of the education system. italy\\'s low attractiveness depends on the country\\'s general situation, especially in view of its feeble job market, the prospects for the economy and the political context. by contrast, the city of milan shows a positive performance according to the most renowned international rankings, such as the economist, the globalization and world cities research network, and qs. some countries consider attracting international students as a by-product of a broader strategy on human capital and they consider it as a priority to be addressed with specific and ad hoc programs, as happens in the uk, france, australia, canada, china and new zealand, for instance. the universities based in these countries can thus count on a “systemic advantage”, while the universities based in countries not practicing such illuminated policies have to compensate with other factors. additional factors affecting the international competitiveness of universities and their attractiveness for international students include the support to higher education through government sponsored scholarships and the ability to attract high quality faculty and researchers. indeed, the quality of faculty and research represents a key factor in determining the international reputation of a higher education institution and of its positioning in the main international rankings. while it is reasonable to assume that the international mobility of university students is likely to slow down in 2020 given the constraints to international travel posed by the covid 19 pandemic crisis, it is also reasonable to assume that this process of globalization of higher education will continue once the current emergency phase is over. on the demand side, a number of other important trends have been emerging in the last few years and are likely to continue in the future. first, the increasing demand for customized programs and individualized learning paths, as opposed to standardized ones. this in turn is leading universities towards the reduction of standardized compulsory parts within degree programs, in favor of shorter and more flexible courses. following this trend, it is likely that an increasing variety and flexibility of programs, to meet evolving students and employers’ needs, will be seen in the future. second, a growing orientation among students toward multi-university experiences, with students aiming at constructing curricula that include different countries and geographies, as well as different fields, with programs jointly offered by different schools of the same university (e.g. engineering and management, entrepreneurship and technology, etc.). this trend is also a reflection of the increasing demand by major employers for graduates with this kind of interdisciplinary competences. 3736 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025figure 11 | evolution of international branch campuses 1970 1980 1990 19951960 2000 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% 1965 1975 1985 2005 2010 2015 250 200 150 100 50 0 third, an increase in students’ attention to services, campus experience and, more generally, value for money. this relates to campus life, with the focus on the availability of sports facilities & extracurricular activities, to the quality of digital interactions, and to the quality of services offered by universities, especially in terms of career development, i.e. internship opportunities and placement. a fourth important trend is the one related to the increasing demand for life-long learning, whereby the process of learning does not end with graduation, but rather continues over the entire working life of an individual. this trend is related to a number of underlying factors: (i) the fast pace of technological change and the need for people to continuously adapt and improve skills and competences, (ii) the fact that, differently from the past, individuals often change work and employer, (iii) the importance that most employers place on the need for constant upskilling and reskilling of human resources. as often mentioned, learning how to learn has become the most important skill for an individual during his/her career. lifelong learning is therefore seen as an “insurance” to cope with skills obsolescence, a driver to catch fast-changing career opportunities and to take advantage of new opportunities in the evolution of professional, social and cultural contexts. this means that the responsibility of universities does not end with graduation but rather continues through lifelong learning. universities all over the world, and especially business schools, are engaged in dealing with this growing demand. from a business school perspective, this means that an integrated, flexible, multichannel portfolio of both off-campus / on-line and on-campus programs should be developed, aimed at actively supporting individuals and organizations dealing with the dynamic of changing environments and skills. as a result, the business model should change from a “single transaction” model to a customer-life cycle one. as an example, in singapore, universities support their graduates to undertake additional studies at preferential rates: graduates can return to attend a master course or a short upskilling module. similar examples exist in other higher education institutions, where new engagement and retention strategies are aimed at achieving seamless student journeys, whereby individuals become lifelong students of the university (e.g. harvard 60-year curriculum, nus lifelong learners program). finally, it is worth mentioning the growing demand for two subjects that are becoming increasingly important for the higher education industry as a consequence of their increasing relevance to the business world: entrepreneurship and sustainability. indeed, the demand for higher education in these two subjects has increased during the last ten years and is likely to significantly grow in the next decade. universities are called to stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit of their students and, at the same time, to favor their sensitivity, awareness and competence on the subject of sustainability. in the area of sustainability europe has been leading the way and should continue to do so. 3.2. | main trends affecting the supply of higher education on the supply side, during the last twenty years universities have themselves been very active internationally, setting up international branch campuses, joint ventures and strategic partnerships. source: cross-border education research team (2017 , january). 3938 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025the different internationalization models reflect different objectives, different investments, and entail different degrees of risk. table 4, taken from an internal analysis by bocconi, highlights the main alternative internationalization strategies, their underlying rationale and targets, together with a number of relevant examples. in some cases, the foreign model developed abroad is also developed at the domestic level through a multi-campus offer (e.g. sciences po and edhec in france; wharton and michigan university in the us, esade and iese in spain, cornell engineering and stem center in new york). a critical factor in these different strategies is the one related to faculty, i.e. whether the faculty active within the international branch, joint venture or off-shore campus is part of the core faculty of the parent company, or whether a new faculty is hired ad hoc. the involvement of the faculty from the parent university is often complex and risks losing motivation and commitment over time. on the other side, establishing a new faculty is potentially counterproductive due to the high synergies, both in terms of teaching and research activities, of one single location and to the critical mass needed to be effective in both teaching and research activities. it is important to highlight that these alternative strategies may have different underlying objectives: (i) exploiting the brand in a foreign market, thereby attracting new students/customers, (ii) enhancing the domestic market students’ experience through an international branch or joint venture, (iii) strengthening of recruiting and executive education in a foreign market. a final trend that has become increasingly significant and is likely to increase in the future is the increasing importance of international partnerships and alliances among universities. these may take different forms: joint programs, double or triple degrees, exclusive networks or alliances such as cems (global alliance of management education), gnam (global network of advanced management), and gppn (global public policy network). these partnerships do not simply allow universities to offer higher value programs, but are also used as marketing tools, signaling membership in prestigious international networks and alliances. on top of the internationalization efforts brought forward by a large number of higher education institutions in the last two decades, a number of other important trends are affecting supply and are likely to be further strengthened in the next decade. the first one is related to the transformation made possible by technological innovation. this transformation has taken different forms. first, the possibility of offering online courses has allowed the emergence of new players such as edx, coursera and udacity. these are platforms where online courses from the best faculty and the most prestigious universities are made freely available to all students. during the last decade, the growth of these massive open online courses (moocs) has been exponential (see figure 12). in 2019, open online courses reached a peak of 110 million students, involving more than 900 universities, for a number of over 13,000 courses. this phenomenon has clear implications for traditional players, as the free availability of high quality content online requires universities to enhance the teaching and learning experience offered through classroom activities. table 4 | universities internationalization strategies type of strategy rationale target multi-local offer a multi-campus or dual campus experience to home students current students/customers and home country prospective ones foreign branch attract students and customers from a different market host country prospective students/ customers joint-venture establish long-term cooperation with a local partner host country students/ customers global strongly affirm global exposure of the brand prospective customers and students with global/regional focus 4140 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025second, technological innovation has led a number of players to launch programs - and not simply individual courses - online. these are fully fledged degrees (e.g. mba) entirely offered online, and where physical face to face modules are offered entirely jointly with online modules. these online degrees are still limited in number (50 online degrees are estimated as at end of 2019), but their growth is expected to be significant in the future. a similar growth has been experienced by modularization and micro-certifications, i.e. short fee based programs offered online (estimated at over 800 in 2019). figure 12 | total number of moocs available, 2012–2019 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 number of courses 12k 10k 8k 6k 4k 2k 0 2019 source: class central, 2020. third, technology has favored the emergence of new players, such as singularity university, kahn academy and a number of consulting companies and corporate universities, especially in the area of executive education (e.g. bcg, mckinsey and bain). indeed, the opportunity to combine consulting with executive training made the executive education market more competitive and more difficult to defend for incumbent schools. finally, technology has enabled adaptive and personalized learning solutions, whereby individuals and corporates have more flexibility in designing programs tailored for their specific needs. the area of post graduate education is the one that has already been and will be mostly affected by technological innovation. indeed, this is potentially the largest and the most permeable segment of the market, where the opportunities offered by online education and distance learning are more significant. here are just a few examples, taken from the us market, of leading schools initiatives in the online executive education arena: (i) wharton started wharton online in 2015 with about 6 courses; today the school offers 60 online classes, and has issued 250,000 certificates; (ii) columbia business school began offering online classes in 2012; in 2020 it reached a portfolio of 24 online programs and is adding new ones each year; (iii) stanford graduate school of business’ lead program, a year-long certificate program, is now in its fifth year, offering a total of 23 online courses; (iv) mit sloan now offers 13 open enrollment executive education classes that run multiple times a year, up from just 4 courses three years ago. (v) university of north carolina’s kenan flagler school of business offers 10 online open executive courses, up from just one in 2017. a second important trend affecting supply is related to expansion of the range of educational offers realized during the last few years by a number of universities. as an example, a number of us business schools, traditionally active only on the executive and mba market, have entered the master of science (msc) segment. a similar expansion has been recently pursued by a number of leading european business schools traditionally active only on the executive and mba markets, such as london business school, iese (barcelona) and insead (paris). this is also explained by the recognized stage of advanced maturity of the mba model, whereas the msc model is becoming more and more important and attractive for employers. 4342 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025similarly, some business schools traditionally focused on the graduate level have entered the bachelor segment (e.g. hec paris). also, schools are converging to cover all the sectors of higher education, from pre- to post-experience and only few players are staying out either of the bachelor or of the executive market. the presence in all segments - bachelor, master of science, mba - under the same brand generates synergies, allows diversification of risk, and strengthens the relationship with corporates, thereby facilitating both placement and fund raising. it is reasonable to assume that this type of expansion will further increase in the near future given the significant problems that the covid 19 pandemic has posed to the executive education segment of the market. a third important trend refers to the increasing role of computer science and data science in education. in recent years, computer and data science departments have significantly grown within universities. computer and data science faculty has been hired in the departments of social science institutions and in general in business schools. more importantly, the number of double degrees blending business and economics with computer science has been developed as a new format and tracks in computer science within mba programs or in general minors and majors in computer science have increased in prominence. lastly, in terms of research it is important to notice the increasing competition from the five digital giants (faang) and other emerging players of the digital economy which are running top-notch research within their own corporate academies and are increasing the bargaining power of professors. a fourth major trend that has affected the supply of higher education and is likely to affect the industry in the next decade is represented by the continuous decrease in public funding. in a context of rising costs and declining public support, universities have been struggling for cash through aggressive fundraising campaigns targeted to alumni, corporates and foundations. the decrease in the amount of public funds received by universities is likely to continue in the future in light of the increase in public deficit that most countries will experience as a consequence of the extraordinary measures adopted during the 2020 pandemic. this will likely make the competition to attract private funding through ambitious fundraising campaigns even stronger in the years to come. a fifth important trend is the one related to the increasing divide between “global” and local or regional universities. as a result of the increasing competition to attract the best students and faculty, it is indeed possible to identify two different types of higher education institutions: global versus national/regional. the first one is represented by institutions with global ambitions, competing at the world level for the best talent. these are the universities that appear in the top positions of all the international rankings, that compete on the international market for faculty, that attract the best students from all over the world, with the majority if not all of their degree programs taught in english and a large part of their graduates employed abroad. the second ones are the regional and national institutions, with a faculty and student body that are largely domestic, that do not actively participate in the international market for researchers, with the majority of their teaching denominated in the national language and the large majority of their graduates employed in the domestic market. the divide between these two groups is likely to increase in the next decade, as the scale of the investments required to belong to the first group is getting more and more significant. also, it is reasonable to assume that this divide will be accelerated by the covid 19 pandemic crisis, as traditional conferences and seminars will lose weight in favor of webinars and digital means to communicate research results. this has clear implications in terms of: (i) the relevance of critical mass of research groups, (ii) the attractiveness of large and high quality research groups for young researchers. it is important to highlight that the competition among these “global institutions” to attract the best talent, both in terms of students and faculty, has been getting tougher and tougher over the years. also, the competitive landscape has itself become more global, with an increasing participation of universities and business schools from the asian continent. tables 5 and 6, based on a very common international ranking, the one on mba programs prepared each year by the financial times, group schools ranked in the top 100 positions by country and by macro-region. one can see that during the last 10 years schools from north america and europe have been gradually losing position to asian schools. indeed, the latter were only 7 in 2009 and have increased to 17 in 2019. this also reflects a fifth trend that characterizes the supply, i.e. the increase in the quality and number of globally competitive institutions in the higher education industry. 4544 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025table 5 | top 100 ft global mba ranking by schools’

trend that has characterized the academic world in the last twenty years is the increasing international competition to attract the most productive research active faculty, leading to an increase in faculty compensation, in individuals’ research budgets and, more generally, in faculty general benefits (e.g. school or housing subsidies). it is reasonable to assume that this trend may be threatened, at least in the near future, by the 2020 covid 19 crisis, as a consequence of two factors: (i) the constraints to international travel and mobility, and (ii) the negative impact on universities’ endowments provoked by the general downturn in financial markets. the latter has a clear impact on the financial budget of major universities and on their capacity to sustain a continuous increase of faculty compensation packages. figure 13 | international collaboration and research impact fwci: field weighted citation impact. source: british council. india per cent of

important opportunity for continental european universities like bocconi in the next few years, as the attractiveness of the two anglosaxon countries declines. finally, on the research activity conducted by universities it is worth mentioning two main trends: (i) the increasing importance of international collaborations, and (ii) the increasing importance of faculty ability to attract research funding. on the first point, figure 13 below reports an analysis based on scopus data, showing the positive correlation between research conducted through international collaborations and its impact in terms of citations. indeed, international collaborations have contributed to a significant increase in the impact of research and to the improvement of research output. on the second point, it is important to highlight that research funding opportunities in italy are especially limited, thereby making eu research funding opportunities especially relevant in our country. 4746 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025what are the consequences and implications of the above mentioned trends? first as content becomes easily available online and can be easily replicated, more active interaction between students and professors becomes necessary, together with a more active student participation in the learning process, possibly through the recourse to the direct use of technologies in the classroom. similarly, the fact that new generations are used to easily finding content and knowledge freely on the web has clear implications for the value added expected by students from class activities and, more generally, university campus life. second it is likely that in the future students from around the world will take courses as they need them, often online, stitching together the equivalent of customized degrees and presenting employers with transcripts of the classes they’ve taken from different providers. this means that universities will need to keep offering immersive degree-based experiences, but at the same time experiment, especially for post graduate education, with more just-in-time, convenient, relatively inexpensive programs that could create lifelong customers who return every time they need to acquire new skills. third given the above mentioned technological trend, the competitive advantage of universities with respect to other players will also be grounded on the capacity to produce cutting edge knowledge through relevant and rigorous research and to the ability to integrate theory and practice. this is consistent with “academic” missions, as research universities become effective when they work on the most pressing societal issues and disseminate research results that shape both academic thinking and business practice. as an example, if we focus our attention on business schools, we can see that the leading players in europe and the us have been reacting in different ways to the competitive dynamics described above in order to face the commoditization of knowledge: (i) by penetrating the pre-experience msc market with flexible and branded programs (e.g. insead, lbs, iese and some us schools), (ii) by expanding their footprints into new content and disciplinary fields such as computer science and data science, (iii) by launching on-line, flexible programs (i.e. mit micromasters) or fully fledged degrees (e.g. cmu, online mba) hosted by platforms (e.g. edx) or building their own platform, often through strategic alliances with new players (e.g. ucl with coursera), (iv) by investing in the value of students’ on-campus “experience”, (v) by embracing the new services and business models for lifelong learning, and (vi) by investing in research (basic and applied). finally an important issue with significant implications for higher education institutions is the one related to the exponential growth of social networks. the new generations of students spend a significant portion of their time on these networks and often tend to become strongly dependent on their use for information and social relations. these passive attitudes make it even more important for higher education institutions to strengthen students’ critical thinking and independence of mind, in order to allow them to properly evaluate and critically distinguish among the huge amount of info and data found on the web. this phenomenon has also clear implications not only for the way higher education institutions design students’ learning processes and the development of their skills, but also from the point of view of research for universities focused on the social sciences. indeed, rigorous research should support the design of public policies aimed at limiting the social and psychological problems generated by young people’s dependence on social networks (based on algorithms designed to extract attention, influence behavior and generate addiction) and the related potential implications for relevant democratic processes such as elections and referenda. 4948 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20253.3. | the relevance of the european dimension as duly examined in the previous paragraph, a major trend affecting higher education is represented by the growing polarization between global and national (or regional or local universities). global institutions have global ambitions and compete at the world level for the best talent. these are the universities and business schools that appear in the top positions of all the international rankings, that compete on the international market for faculty, that attract the best students from all over the world, with the majority if not all of their degree programs taught in english and a large part of their graduates employed abroad. bocconi shall aim to be a global institution and its strategic evolution in the last 20 years clearly shows the progress made to reach this ambitious goal. it has to be recalled, however, that in the case of an italian higher education institution like bocconi, between the national and the global dimension one must also consider the european dimension, as a link and a catalyst between the other two. in fact, if the global dimension is a geographical one, but without a correspondent institutional framework, and the national dimension has on the contrary both attributes, institutional and geographical, though the latter with limited “critical mass”, the eu level matches the two in a sort of “augmented configuration”. it is in fact a geographical entity, and it has its own institutional framework for higher education. figure 14 | institutional and geographical dimensions geographical \"critical mass” institutional dimension in higher education limited extended no full national eu global 5150 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025to help european universities gaining enough “critical mass” to compete at the global level, in 2017 the european council (ec) has launched the “european universities” initiative aimed at strengthening strategic partnerships across the eu between higher education institutions and encouraging the emergence by 2024 of some \\'european universities\\', consisting in bottom-up networks of universities across the eu, which will enable students to obtain a degree by combining studies in several eu countries and contribute to the international competitiveness of european universities. the next step already announced by the ec will be to remove the existing barriers at eu level to facilitate the transnational operation and the transformation of higher education institutions towards the universities of the future. such a transformation requires much deeper cooperation between higher education institutions across the eu, removal of barriers to this deeper cooperation, in particular in terms of mobility (including recognition of qualifications, language learning, and other favoring framework conditions), quality, governance (including possible eu-level degrees and statute) and financing (eu, national and regional), and boosting the capacity of higher education institutions to deliver in a synergetic manner on the four missions of universities (education, research, innovation and service to society). if the latter were further enhanced, the eu would be able to act in the global competitive arena of higher education more and more as an integrated market, with a shared institutional framework, for the benefit of member states’ universities first of all. the major benefit lies in the capacity to compete globally with a “systemic” reputation. this is crucial research-wise, to develop and retain best talented scholars, and to attract top scholars from outside europe, thanks to better access to funding (both public grants and private donations). a similar advantage can be reproduced with regard to the student body, enabling to attract and retain the best talented students worldwide, thanks to stronger educational institutions in terms of faculty, research capacity and educational outreach. the outcome would be a powerful enrichment of human capital and research/innovation ability at the eu level. for universities, this would also imply positive fall-outs in terms of better capacity to contribute to the advancement of society and satisfy the needs of a fast changing job market. needless to say, all the above would positively reflect upon positionings of eu based universities in global rankings. it is worth underlining that the role of the european union in higher education, though not always so well-known to the general public, has been of paramount importance in promoting, for instance, cross-border student mobility - notably through the erasmus project - and research activity, mostly through the european research council (erc). the european union also promoted innovations that have spread outside its own domain: the introduction of the three-cycle education system consisting of bachelor, master and doctoral studies (e.g. “bologna process”) has in the long-run changed the competitive arena, as proved by the fact that also prestigious us business schools have launched their own master of science programs. thanks to its deep-rooted commitment to the european integration process, bocconi is already part of the “european university” project, as a founding member of civica - the european university of the social sciences. believing in europe as a gate to the world, bocconi shall continue to pursue its european identity, also becoming more vocal with eu-institutions to promote the advancement of the institutional dimension. 5352 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025vision 2030 and strategic plan 2021-2025 part 2 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025strategic goals driving vision 2030 4. the analysis carried out in the first part of this document has highlighted the economic and demographic scenario with which bocconi will be confronted in the next decade, with particular focus on the major trends affecting the higher education area more directly, such as the job market’s prospective dynamics and the challenges/opportunities related to a fast-changing competitive arena (including expected impacts of the covid-19 pandemic). the aforementioned facts and figures were shared with a broad range of internal stakeholders (the university board, the international advisory council, faculty and staff members, students representatives, the bocconi alumni community board). thanks in good part to their significant contributions the executive committee was able to identify the six strategic goals that drive bocconi vision 2030 and will define our university going forward. each strategic goal was assigned to a working group, made up of both faculty and staff members, in charge of analyzing it and proposing a set of long-term actions aiming for achievement by 2030. a special thanks is deemed to the working group members: jérome adda, pierpaolo

1 4 2 5 3 6 5756 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20251 | a leading independent international university in the social sciences bocconi university strongly values its independence and freedom from any political and economic power. always proud of its italian roots, bocconi is already a leading european research and teaching university in the social sciences. our ambition for the next decade is to consolidate our positioning in europe and to progressively narrow the gap with first-rate global players in our academic domains, e.g. economics, management, legal studies and the social sciences at large. our vision of the social sciences expands to include those disciplines, such as data/computer science and cognitive sciences, that have a great disruptive impact on business and society. these areas are changing profoundly the dynamics underpinning how economic and social relations unfold, and more generally are helping in understand and address the big challenges of our times within a multi-disciplinary framework. we believe that attracting talented students from all over the world and enabling them to access high-quality tertiary education, regardless of their families’ economic and social condition, are the pillars of bocconi educational mission, which starts at the undergraduate level. bachelor programs represent an internationally recognized strength of bocconi and, as such, need to be carefully enriched and reinforced, also leveraging the uncommon capability of matching high quality with high numbers that the university has developed through the years. our aspiration for the next decade is to harness the best minds and resources to provide our students with the most relevant and engaging educational experience, blending theory with practice and ensuring that students coming to milan from all over the world, from the most diverse backgrounds, enjoy a fulfilling and rewarding experience at bocconi. 2 | a university committed to the advancement of knowledge through rigorous and relevant research during the next decade, bocconi will emphasize its research university nature more and more, firmly believing that the advancement of knowledge through original research is the cornerstone of modern world-class universities. with the aim of becoming the leading social science university in continental europe by 2030, bocconi will mainstream research in all its activities, primarily by recognizing the pivotal role of research-oriented faculty (scholars) in advancing knowledge, and consequently attracting students/relevant stakeholders (employers, donors, etc.) to the university and contributing to the university’s performance in rankings. universities are build-to-last institutions, since they are endemically oriented to future generations. this is particularly true with regard to research and its continuity in time, which must be ensured through a rigorous process of selection and training of next generation scholars (ph.d.). last but not least, the involvement of dedicated staff is integral to effectively perform the research activity in a highly competitive environment. 5958 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20253 | a university offering a life transforming learning experience of the highest academic quality bocconi intends to develop an outstanding learning experience from undergraduate to executive education. the capability to have such a multidimensional offer - undergraduate, graduate, phd, mbas and executive -, fueled by rigorous and relevant research, represents a pillar of the bocconi value proposition. our educational offer unfolds along two synergetic dimensions, both pivotal to make the student journey unique and fully rewarding in the long run: the teaching model, aimed at enabling students to understand and elaborate concepts and theories; to apply knowledge for analyzing and solving problems using a critical thinking approach; to transfer the knowledge and experience acquired also outside the classroom, to address real-life cases; the level of personalization of the learning path. lifelong learning 1 experience 2 glocal 3 discovery 4 innovation 5 with particular reference to the future challenge facing our msc programs, some considerations regarding competition becoming fiercer for this kind of programs specifically (with new competitors emerging in the international arena), bocconi’s choices (admission process, size of programs, domestic focus, binding curricula, etc.) and the italian context (outbound talent mobility, country’s attractiveness for foreign students, feeble job market, etc.) push towards an evolution of the master of sciences as leading graduate programs offering a more personalized and digital learning experience. besides global scenario and competitive trends, both the teaching model and the level of personalization are also deeply impacted by the evolution of technology, which is as well a key driver and an enabler of life-long learning. lifelong learning will be a key driver for sda bocconi, together with other five pillars identified for 2025 and associated to specific actions and kpis: 6160 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20254 | a university promoting impact and engagement of all its stakeholders in a context dominated by increasing competition among top tier institutions in attracting the best students/faculty and resources at large, shrinking public funding, and limits to the increase of student intake and tuition fees, universities rely more and more on individuals and corporates to raise the funds needed to fulfil their mission of contributing to the advancement of knowledge and educating future generations of citizens. bocconi’s positioning in this area already rests on solid ground: our university has in fact a deep-rooted tradition of strong and mutually-satisfactory relations with our stakeholders, primarily the business world, and our network of more of 120,000 alumni based in 158 countries represents an asset for bocconi around the globe. while proud of our achievements, we are not complacent, as we are aware of the gravity of the challenges that lie ahead, and hence determined to do more over the next decade to enhance alumni engagement and fund raising, also relying on the full support of all our stakeholders, in primis the university governance, faculty and staff. at the same time, due to the coronavirus emergency and the economic crisis that goes with it, we expect a reduction in the resources available for philanthropic causes and most probably a readdressing of donors’ priorities towards more pandemic-related issues, which escalates the level of uncertainty affecting our planning activity, at least in the short-term. by 2030 we thus aim at becoming a leading university in europe to engage alumni, corporates, individuals and organizations in sustaining: access to higher education (drive social mobility through education); human capital development (advance knowledge for a better world); the community and the environment in which we live (enhance sustainability and the quality of facilities and campus life). 5 | an open university supporting social mobility, inclusivity, diversity and sustainability universities are no longer ivory towers: they are, on the contrary, open and dynamic organizations, where people gather to build a better future by nurturing new ideas, acquiring and sharing knowledge and enriching experiences. in this context, bocconi is, and will be, committed to pursuing its core research and educational objectives in an environment (physical and intellectual) where all students, faculty and staff receive, and offer to others, equality of opportunity and treatment, irrespective of their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, age or economic conditions. bocconi, intended both as a community of people (students, faculty, staff, alumni) and as a cluster of physical facilities (above all, the campus in milan), has to be considered as a system which both receives from and impacts on the external environment and, as a system, has the duty and need to be open and inclusive, as well as to be in its turn included, into the broader community to which it belongs, at the local, national and international level. we are open to bright and motivated students, regardless of their background, and determined to provide them with the knowledge and tools that realize their full potential: today as students, tomorrow in work and society. well aware that sustainability, in its many forms, is the global challenge facing us all, we will continue to be fully committed to achieving more sustainable, inclusive and forward-looking development for future generations, devoting time and energy to this purpose. all the above shall appropriately be designed, implemented and communicated internally and externally. bocconi must become and be perceived as home of diversity, intercultural understanding, community engagement, inclusion and sustainability. a safe physical and virtual space. 6362 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20256 | a university promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in the digital society, technology breakthroughs follow one another at a speed that has never been experienced before in history, imposing not only new products and services, but radically transforming the way we learn, work and live. understanding innovation trends has thus become a key requirement for any student in the social sciences. for the same reasons, developing an entrepreneurial mindset - open to new ideas and challenges, flexible, proactive, with a responsible but above-average risk-taking propensity – is an asset not only for would-be entrepreneurs, but for anybody approaching the job market now and even more in the years to come. the above-mentioned trends have a significant impact on higher education and universities have developed a number of tools (contests, hackathons, labs, accelerators, incubators, etc.) designed to boost students’ ability to face up to innovative ventures. at the same time, academic applied research has a long tradition in producing spillovers/spin offs that, through technology transfer practices, bring to the market innovations originally conceived within university departments, accomplishing, in this way, also the so called “third mission”. consistently with this framework and its expected evolution, by 2030 bocconi aims at creating a fertile ground for innovation and entrepreneurship by developing and matching technical talent with business skills through its educational model that applies solid knowledge on theoretical frameworks and data science to solve practical problems. more specifically, we envisage bocconi in 2030 as: a dynamic and innovative institution which provides a learning environment for students that integrates the latest technology with a human touch; a top european business university renowned worldwide for providing students with the best skills needed to successfully navigate the job market and find work or to launch their own businesses; a hub for startups, corporates and investors to boost entrepreneurship while connecting students, faculty and staff with the external business and policy context. 6564 vision 2030 & strategic plan 2025strategic plan 2021-2025 5. once the path to 2030 was nailed down, working groups were engaged to carve out the strategic plan to 2025, underpinning the subsequent economic and financial plan (which unfolds in part 3 of this document). the five year strategic plan consists of 45 actions, which were analytically described in terms of: among the 45 actions and relative targets, the executive committee selected the main quantitative targets for 2025, that will comprise the key metrics to monitor the university’s trajectory to 2025. goal: actions major achievement; drivers: what needs to be done to achieve the goal; threats and risks: potential hurdles to the goal’s achievement; targets: quantitative/qualitative breakdown of milestones within the planning timeframe (2021-2025), in order to achieve the goal. 1 2 3 4 6766 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20251 | main quantitative targets for 2025 targets were grouped into four areas: 2 | students, schools and rankings with regard to “students, schools and rankings”, we plan to keep the overall number of students flat, at approx. 15,000 students. at the same time, we will slightly rebalance the mix between the undergraduate and graduate levels by increasing the intake of bachelor programs and symetrically reducing the intake of master of science programs. this will allow us to further consolidate our competitive advantage at the undergraduate level and, at the same time, to enhance the level of faculty-students interaction and personalization of the learning process for mscs. with regard to enrolled students and the their international and experiential exposure, we want to further expand the portfolio of opportunities available at the undergraduate level, by increasing the percentage of students with at least one internship experience to 70% in 2025 and the percentage of students with a study abroad experience to 52% in 2025. to address the social mobility challenge, we plan to increase the overall amount of financial aid, tuition waivers, etc. to over € 45 million in 2025, from the current € 30 million. special actions will be put in place to reach out to talented students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and to students whose families have been particularly hit by the economic fallout of the covid-19 pandemic, to allow them to benefit from high quality tertiary education. finally, with regard to rankings and the increasingly tough competition universities are faced with, we plan to select the rankings that matter the most for bocconi in the social sciences domain. we are going to concentrate our efforts to reach the top 3 positions in the eu and the top 20 in the world by 2025 for the chosen rankings, also as a gateway for the even more ambitious goals set for 2030. the above mentioned quantitative targets are summarized in the table below. students, schools and rankings 1 diversity 3 faculty, research and staff 2 alumni, fundraising and b4i 4 2020 2025 n. of students 15,000 15,000 ug students\\'

students, schools, rankings 6968 vision 2030 & strategic plan 20253 | faculty, research and staff with regard to “faculty, research and staff”, we plan to further expand our capacity to attract top-notch talent from the international job market and offer them an ideal environment to live, teach and research. more specifically, we plan to increase both research and teaching faculty, reaching an overall number of 470 faculty members in 2025. combined with a flat number of students, this remarkable rise in hirings will allow us to improve the student/faculty ratio. we also plan to increase up to 70% by 2025 the teaching hours delivered by core faculty, in function of both the teaching model’s evolution and new programs launched. additional faculty also means additional research opportunities to be exploited. therefore, we plan to increase the number of international research grants (horizon 2020, erc, etc.) hosted by bocconi to 59 in 2025. bocconi will continue to invest in research also by increasing both department funding, thus providing departments with more autonomy and subsequent accountability, and individual research funding. a lighter expansion is planned for administrative staff, which should grow to 700+ fte in 2025 from current 650. the above mentioned quantitative targets are summarized in the table below. 2020 2025 core faculty 376 470 int.l research grants (e.g. erc, h2020) 44 59 staff (fte) 650 700+ figure 16 | faculty, research, staff 4 | diversity the need to improve notably our community’s diversity - broadly defined - has emerged across various working groups. though openness to diversity is more of a cultural attitude, thus difficult to capture by numbers in its essence, we have identified some specific quantitative targets that represent a reasonably robust proxy for this multi-faceted attribute. they include nationality, gender and experiences and extend to faculty, students and staff members. it has to be noted, as shown in the table below, that in the case of staff the proposed action in favor of gender balance works “the other way round”, e.g. we need to increase the percentage of male staff members. 2020 2025

2030 & strategic plan 20255 | alumni, fundraising and b4i alumni are a driving force of modern univerisities. their personal and professional achievements contribute to the institution’s reputation. they can act as ambassadors towards prospective students, as employers for graduates, as customers for life-long learning initiatives, and as donors who give back to their alma mater. bocconi pursues alumni engagement through its alumni community (bac), which is expected to grow overall and specifically in terms of active alumni - 5,000 in 2025 - and alumni donors - 3,000 in 2025. the community will also be nurtured with fresh energy, as students will be involved from their “day one” on campus, thus a target of students enrolling in bac has been set (45% in 2025) as well. the increase in the alumni community’s expected contribution to the university’s fund raising effort will allow us to diversify and rebalance the sources of funds between individuals, on one hand, and corporates/organizations, on the other hand. we plan to augment the funds annually pledged from the current level of € 10-12 million per year to approx. 20 million by 2025. alumni and students that want to become entrepreneurs or to create innovative ventures have also the opportunity to benefit from the support of b4i; as well, alumni in primis - though not exclusively - will have the chance to invest in b4i startups themselves, contributing to reaching the ambitious target that have been set. figure 18 | alumni, fundraising, b4i 2020 2025 alumni 128,000 144,000 active alumni 5,000 alumni

       " '1 when we set out to develop vision 2030 for the university of cape town (uct), the only element that was clear was that we could not use the typical approach to developing strategies for universities. vision 2030 could not be a document that would end up lost at the bottom of a website or forgotten in a drawer. we wanted vision 2030 to respond to the challenge put to us by the vice-chancellor: to shape and lead change. with some trepidation we started the development of a living strategy – an idea that is constantly reshaped in different parts of the organisation that elicits an emotional and intellectual commitment across all sectors of our community. we thank the vice-chancellor for constantly pushing us to think differently. we struggled with the notion that our massive transformative purpose could not be the same as the vision and mission of conventional strategies. rather, it is to be the aspirational dream that makes us come to work every day, and to which we give our boundless energy. we are pleased to note that in the consultative sessions that we have held, uct’s massive transformative purpose has elicited not only support; in general, the uct community has responded with enthusiasm and a sense of hope and inspiration for our future possibilities. from the very beginning we wanted to bring all the members and groups of the university together. in particular, we wanted to bridge the conceptual separation between support and academic functions and ensure that the capabilities and management systems needed to make the vision real were not an afterthought. with this idea of a new, integrated and collaborative uct in mind, we created cross-functional task teams in which the core academic functions and the cross-cutting professional, administrative and support functions were fully represented in all discussions. as ‘university’ people, we had to overcome our biases towards what we could learn from the business sector. we wrestled with new fads and old conservatism. we wondered about what ‘outside’ people could offer in helping us think about what our university could look like and feel like in the future. we are very grateful to the members of the futures think tank, who dared to start the dream that helped clear the way for new conversations to begin in our various cross-functional teams. what is before you is a product that can still be improved, changed and perfected as it becomes real in the different sections of the university. it is the fruit of the deep commitment to uct of nearly 100 people who participated directly in fashioning it. we are proud of having been part of this journey. vision 2030 planning team foreword forewordvision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society vice-chancellor’s introduction vision 2030 is the result of inclusive and transformative leadership at uct. close to 100 staff members from across the academic, and the professional, administrative support and service (pass) departments contributed to the initial development of this document, and further contributions are expected from across the uct campus community as we progress. we wanted to signal from the very beginning that vision 2030 belongs to – and is the responsibility of – every member of the uct community. at the same time, we wanted to produce a living document that will guide and inspire staff and students to use their creativity and imagination to bring vision 2030 to life on the ground. 3 vision 2030 comes from a place of discomfort. first, it comes from discomfort with the idea that the future is a place where we arrive, and to which we have to adapt. instead, i have challenged all of us at uct to shape and lead the future. the work of the futures think tank, which i created when i took office in 2018, constituted a crucial step in this journey. second, vision 2030 comes from discomfort with any complacency about uct’s status as the top-ranked university in afrika. instead, i challenged the university to take a critical view of itself by defining excellence, transformation and sustainability as interdependent, so that we can be the best for afrika. third, it comes from discomfort with uct’s colonial and apartheid history, and the need to affirm our university’s afrikan identity, reclaim afrikan agency, and commit to the future of the continent, as a global afrikan university. as we explain in the text that follows, we symbolise this in our spelling of ‘afrika’. vision 2030 comes from a place of hope and commitment. it affirms our capacity to unleash our creative energy and our intellectual capacity to change the world into a better place for all. commitment is what will transform this vision into reality. vision 2030 comes from a place of decisiveness and trust. it is not a blueprint for people to obey, but a road map for rethinking, reimagining, reenergising and repurposing our work. we will have to make difficult but necessary choices: to stop some of the things we are doing and initiate new things. i trust in the capacity of the broader uct community to do this. vision 2030 has been a year in the making. planning teams, cross-functional teams and working groups applied themselves to the task of giving expression to our massive transformative purpose – “unleash human potential to create a fair and just society” – in the core academic functions, the cross-cutting responsibilities of transformation and social responsiveness, and the systems that support and sustain uct’s work. it is pleasing to realise that many of the topics that became the focus of global discussion with the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic were already being discussed in the context of vision 2030. this suggests we are on the right path. we have consulted widely about vision 2030. under covid-19 conditions, the executive presented vision 2030 and interacted with approximately 3 500 staff members. in the end, through six virtual sessions, we reached many more people than we would have through the original approach. we had focused engagements with labour and with students and presented vision 2030 for discussion in senate and council, where it was finally approved. the predominant feeling in all these engagements was one of enthusiasm, interest and commitment. uct staff asked pointed, important questions about the implementation of vision 2030, the integration of the vision’s goals and how we will resource the work required to achieve them, and the space for freedom. i am very grateful for these questions, as they forced us to think harder and more clearly about our vision. the impact of covid-19 on the global economy and on south afrika has been serious. we will have to begin implementing vision 2030 taking full cognisance of the financial constraints within which we will have to operate, but also of the need to prioritise key projects that will serve as our vision’s scaffolding. i have no doubt that the consultative and integrated manner in which we have worked to develop vision 2030 will serve us well in the process of implementation. i would like to thank the members of the executive for their excellent teamwork and collegiality in the development of vision 2030. thank you also to the futures think tank, and to all uct staff who took part in the consultation process by adding their questions, thoughts and ideas to this document. i look forward to working with the whole uct community and our external stakeholders in unleashing human potential to create a fair and just society. #unleash professor mamokgethi phakeng vice-chancellor vice-chancellor’s introductionvision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society the road we have travelled in july 2018 uct’s newly appointed vice-chancellor, professor mamokgethi phakeng, introduced her vision for the university and adopted a future orientation to drive the thinking behind the development of a new strategic plan. professor phakeng presented the three pillars that, for her, represented the foundation of the academic project at uct – excellence, transformation and sustainability – and challenged the university to imagine what a successful and thriving uct would look like in 2030. the approach in developing uct’s strategic planning framework 2016–2020 was greatly influenced by the student protests of 2015 and 2016 and took its cue from the areas where the least progress had been made in relation to the objectives of the previous strategic plan. vision 2030 presented an opportunity to be more forward looking, and to take a different approach to strategic planning. having considered a number of alternatives, uct adopted a hybrid approach, based largely on roger martin’s book playing to win: how strategy really works. it was led by professor kosheek sewchurran of uct’s graduate school of business and informed by the work already done by the futures think tank, led by the dean of the faculty of engineering & the built environment, professor alison lewis, and facilitated by engineer and futurist, abbas jamie. 1 5 martin’s approach to strategy is popular in business, and we translated it to suit uct as an organisation. from this perspective, a strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions an organisation in its industry so it can create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition. we were especially interested in working with the notion of an integrated set of choices, and of creating sustainable advantage. what is unique about what uct can offer that will sustain the value of the university into the future? the fundamental approach to the development of the strategy is based on the cascading down of strategic choices, from the institutional level to the implementation units. in practical terms, this implied thinking strategically: as uct in relation to the core functions (teaching and learning, and research); in relation to the six faculties and their departments; and in relation to the different departments that provide professional and support services for the university. in doing this, transformation and social engagement were regarded as the cross-cutting elements of our ethos; they must be present in all strategic choices at all levels in order to be effective. the responsibility for driving the development of vision 2030 was allocated by the vicechancellor to deputy vice-chancellor associate professor lis lange and chief operating officer dr reno morar. the approach taken is based on two principles: strategic integration, and buy-in from uct. in order to make this effective, the following structures have been set up: • vision 2030 planning team • cross-functional task team (vision 2030 planning team and representatives from the deans and executive directors) • extended task team (cross-functional task team and strategic invitees, including academics, students and key portfolio holders). two cross-functional working groups (teaching and learning, and research) take responsibility for translating the institutional-level strategic decisions to the core functions. as already mentioned, we followed a rigorous process of engagement with internal stakeholders, and obtained support and approval from uct governance structures. the rest of this document presents the context of our thinking process, and vision 2030 itself. figure 2: cascades of choice – from roger martin’s playing to win, adapted for uct the road we have travelled vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society taking stock and moving forward2 uct is one of the oldest universities in south afrika. over the years, it has achieved an international reputation as a research-intensive university. it offers a wide range of professional and formative degrees at the undergraduate level, as well as postgraduate studies up to doctoral level. like most english-speaking colonial universities in south afrika, uct has a contradictory history. moulded over its existence on the western tradition of university excellence, uct has struggled with its own identity, culture and position in society. while under apartheid it stood for academic freedom and its right to teach all students, this position was not always consistent when it came to black academic staff and campus segregation. uct’s political resistance to apartheid, as imperfect as it was, constituted an important base for starting the process of deracialising and transforming the university. with the 1994 democratic elections this process was accelerated for the whole country, and uct was no exception. however, the focus and nature of transformation at uct came under critical scrutiny during 2015–2017. this forced the university to engage critically with its colonial history, its current identity, its culture, its relationship to society and its location in afrika. 7 chinua achebe, the prominent nigerian novelist, said, “there is that great proverb – that until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.” uct’s choice to spell ‘afrika’ with a ‘k’ is an invitation to reclaim afrika’s agency, and use it to validate the global character of the local in the 21st century. it is in this context that uct chooses to be a global university in afrika. in the last two decades, the world has changed in ways that obliged universities to rethink their purpose and location in society if they did not want to become obsolete. climate change, growing inequality, the fourth industrial revolution, population displacement, and now a global pandemic accompanied by a deep economic crisis are elements of our world that force us into a new type of consciousness. uct must engage with these matters in their local manifestations and global implications. into the 21st century, and in light of the critique of the last few years, we need to rethink who we are, what we do, how we do it and who benefits from our work. while uct performs very well by most teaching and research indicators, the current model of the university is not sufficiently responsive to the needs of a new generation of diverse students and academics eager to respond to the world’s challenges. despite its location in afrika, uct’s afrikan roots are not sufficiently valued and foregrounded in its global performance as a research university, or in its curriculum. uct has greater potential to innovate in teaching, research and social engagement than it is currently doing. the covid-19 crisis has shown uct’s capacity to lead with innovative responses and imagination. in this context, uct took a bold step when it decided to lead and shape the future instead of choosing to react and follow. professor phakeng set up a futures think tank under this banner, creating the space for daring the university to realise its potential to be a trailblazer and a thought leader. the work of the futures think tank helped uct to come up with a purpose for its work that functions simultaneously as an aspiration and as the beginning of the road map to change. what we call a ‘massive transformative purpose’ is the idea that inspires the whole uct community to be the best we can be. as a university, uct by definition has two fundamental responsibilities: to cultivate and nurture the capabilities of the younger generation for them to become leaders in different spheres of life, and to provide the conditions for academics to produce research that broadens our understanding of the social and natural worlds and the relationship between them. taking this – the inalienable purpose of the university – as a point of departure, we decided to elevate our mission to embrace the world, and thus chose as our purpose ‘unleash human potential to create a fair and just society’. this purpose is an affirmation of the inherent creativity of humanity, as well as a recognition that the state of the world (social and natural) needs changing. life is not fair, just or sustainable unless we are capable of changing important aspects of what we think and what we do. before the covid-19 pandemic, we had focused on inequality, climate change, waste and the circular economy, sustainable livelihoods, urbanisation, transport and mobility, disease, public health, and the role of technology and data in society as some of the core areas that need research in order to produce a new understanding. as the pandemic moves through the world, we see these areas become even more visible and urgent. we believe that the crisis we find ourselves in today makes the focus of this vision ever more relevant. the rest of this document invites you to our journey to vision 2030. taking stock and moving forward unleash human potential to create a fair and just societyvision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society vision 2030 for uct3 3.1 who do we want to be? our dream is to draw from the extraordinary social and cultural diversity, creativity and capacity for innovation of all our staff and students to contribute to making the 21st century the afrikan century; to look at ourselves as a university, and together create the top global university in afrika – a university that is uncompromising in its transformative intent, deeply rooted in academic excellence, and one that strives for social, environmental and financial sustainability. we will call on our staff and students to work together, in education and in research, to have real impact on our ability to tackle society’s problems and to effect positive change in the world. 9 uct will continue to attract students with exceptional potential from our country, our continent and our world. located in the western cape, uct draws students from the rest of south afrika and 135 other countries in afrika and the rest of the world. this diversity provides an extraordinary opportunity to develop a culture of inclusivity, collaboration and dialogue in the manner in which we educate undergraduate and postgraduate students. uct will work to ensure that all the members of its community have a voice, and a real sense of their agency and value for the university. in line with its purpose, uct will offer a transformative and socially engaged undergraduate and postgraduate education, enabling our graduates to use their knowledge, skills and sense of responsibility to shape and to be at the service of society, locally and globally. in line with the growing importance of technology in society and its impact on the manner in which the new generations learn, uct will provide both contact and digitally enabled education framed by sound pedagogy aimed at developing creativity, analytical thinking, complex problem-solving abilities, collaboration and social responsibility, across disciplines and fields of study. uct already offers a wide range of short courses that fill the needs of graduates for continuous education. uct will expand its capacity to offer continuous education and micro-credentials to respond to the changing needs of the world of work and the emergence of new jobs. persistent world hunger, poverty and inequality, climate change and health crises are just some of the complex social and environmental issues that if not addressed will exacerbate current societal and economic inequalities into the future. uct will produce research that answers the complex problems of today and tomorrow. to do this, it will advance inter-, multi- and transdisciplinary research approaches so as to better understand the past, and define and tackle current and future problems. finally, in support of building a fair and just society, uct will strengthen its scholarly ability to work collaboratively with local and international social actors. as a university, uct is well placed to lead conversations with government, industry and other role players in the pursuit of new knowledge that will contribute towards our massive transformative purpose. vision 2030 for uct 3.2 what the dream looks like vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society we will offer holistic, innovative, futureoriented education at undergraduate and postgraduate level. uct not only produces graduates for the labour market, but educates thinkers who are capable of shaping, adapting and responding to the unknown – global citizens who are actively responsible for the world they have inherited, and who will leave a better world for future generations. our success in this area will depend on our ability to ensure that academics are trained higher-education teachers, the introduction of transformative pedagogies in the classroom environment, the ability to renew the curriculum and provide the necessary infrastructure for teacher and students to learn together, the resources and networks to provide real work experience as part of the degree, and administrative and student support systems that contribute to a seamless student experience. as a top research university in afrika, uct is well placed, with unique opportunities in our continent to find innovative ways of doing things. we will focus on research that highlights these unique opportunities and solve problems that matter, on the understanding that afrika’s problems are the problems of the world, and that we are in a privileged position to be able to contribute to this enterprise. to do this, we must ensure that we continue to expand our local and international partnerships, improve the diversity and functionality of our interdisciplinary research teams, and develop and maintain stateof-the-art research management and support systems and facilities. uct will distinguish itself by providing thought leadership on social justice. the lens through which we look at the world should be that of the collective public intellectual, participating in and influencing the public debate. in order to achieve this, uct will put in place communication platforms to make our teaching and learning, and research enterprises visible and accessible; policies and frameworks that enable, support and recognise civic engagement by staff and students; and bold policies and practices that support equity and cultural transformation. 3.3 making it real11 finally, uct will be an employer of choice, because it develops and fosters an organisational ethos that supports new ways of thinking, being and doing. the view of a fairer society will start with how uct functions as an organisation. in order to support this vision, we need to foster an organisational culture that incentivises innovation and creativity, and we need to galvanise staff and students into action to develop and maintain a sustainable campus. this will be supported by policies, systems and change management that focus on environmental, social and financial sustainability. the whole uct community together will strive for resilience, sustainability and transformation. all of this will find its home on a campus that provides and uses its existing physical infrastructure in an innovative manner, suitable for the service of the 21st century and beyond. we will find space for inter-, multi- and transdisciplinary teams to work, and explore ways in which we can teach and learn and undertake research from our own environment. in this section of vision 2030 we have presented uct’s strategic choices at institutional level. this is our collective commitment that will be required to work towards a uct that unleashes human potential to create a fair and just society. in the next two sections we present how the integrative approach works in relation to the traditional core functions of the university: teaching and learning, and research. we have also applied the approach of bringing together core functions and cross-cutting areas to the development of strategic choices in teaching and learning, and in research. each working group was built around the core functions, but had memberships from cross-cutting areas in transformation and social engagement, and in the support and professional services. vision 2030 for uct vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society taking as our departure uct’s purpose to unleash human potential to create a fair and just society, the teaching and learning portfolio will work to unleash students’ potential through education to be resilient agents of change for themselves and in society. to be the top global university in afrika in the area of teaching and learning, uct must make contextually relevant choices that explain what we do, where we do it and how we do it. the type of education offered by vision 2030 is framed by the question of what kind of graduates are needed in the 21st century. to answer this question, we take into account the needs of our students, the changes in the different knowledge fields, and the broader expectations in the social functioning of university graduates in a plural society. this covers aspects such as curriculum, student engagement, modes of delivery, and very importantly, the pedagogies we employ. in relation to the curriculum, we have a dual focus: • to offer innovative curricula at the cutting edge of disciplines and professions, to enable our students to use and develop the latest technologies, knowledge and skills to enter and contribute to different knowledge fields, to the workplace and to civil society in the 21st century • to offer a socially engaged curriculum that balances the local and the global, to enable our students to have ready access to the skills and knowledge required to exercise their sense of social citizenship in the creation of a sustainable and regenerative world. teaching and learning 4.1 who do we want to be? 4.2 what the dream looks like13 students’ experiences of their learning process are a key element to their success. we must offer the type of learning environment that facilitates students’ engagement with their own learning to allow them to express their agency and contribute to the curriculum. the current generation of students and staff interact with digital media as part of their educational experience. and yet, in the context of our response to covid-19, we have seen that this can also accentuate social inequality and exclusion. uct will ensure increased network connectivity and access to mobile devices for students and staff in order to offer democratically appropriate digitally enabled education at undergraduate, postgraduate and continuous education levels. this will allow us to expose our students to the latest learning technologies in an appropriate environment without sacrificing equity or student engagement with their teachers and peers. our teachers need to be self-reflective on the effectiveness of their teaching practices, and to recognise, include and respect the contribution of students to their classes. in order to do this, we will continually renew and transform our pedagogies. 4.3 making it real uct will provide education across the disciplines and professions that focuses on developing graduate attributes targeted at the self, the community and the world. in relation to the self, we will teach our students skills to develop emotional intelligence, creativity and critical thinking, complex problem-solving, judgement and decisionmaking, and cognitive flexibility. in relation to the community, we will work with our students to cultivate their ability to manage people, to coordinate with others, to be service orientated and to be able to negotiate. finally, in relation to the world, uct students will be provided with opportunities to develop a sense of afrikan citizenship and global citizenship, responsibility towards the natural teaching and learning environment, and strong valorisation of cultural diversity. we see our students developing a specific set of skills, qualities and perspectives that will cultivate their knowledge and intellect, as well as their responsibilities towards the community and the broader world. in their journey, uct students will be exposed to different learning approaches, infusing environmental education, design thinking and interdisciplinary education in their studies. these methods will allow students to develop approaches to engaging with the world in a more holistic way, and to understand their own actions, abilities and behaviour in relation to others. by providing a problem-based education that takes place at both the university and the workplace, our students will be taught to understand problems as challenges and as opportunities, and will encounter real-world issues within a supportive environment that stresses the importance of the educational process. while our students have exceptional potential, we must commit to our role in unleashing that potential. this can only be done if we acknowledge and encourage our students to embrace the very different environments and experiences from which they come, and to use the knowledge and skills they have acquired to make the most of their opportunities. to support their success and excellence, we will offer well-developed student and academic support systems. we will leverage and harness our data analytics capabilities to provide relevant information to the students, to their lecturers and tutors, and to our support departments in order to sustain the development of the whole person. all of this will take place in an organisational context in which physical infrastructure will be at the service of 21st-century education; planning frameworks will be designed to ensure that our educational values remain fundamental to our disciplines, programmes and curricula; and we will provide support for the development of our staff as university teachers. vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society research5 as uct is the top research university in afrika, and guided by uct’s purpose to unleash human potential to create a fair and just society, the university’s research portfolio will focus on unleashing knowledge in and from afrika to redefine and co-create a sustainable global future. to be the top global research university in afrika, recognised for its excellence and relevance, uct researchers must make choices around the kind of research we want to do, where to focus, and how we do that research. through its focus on afrika and its positioning in the world, uct’s research will enhance quality of life in south afrika and on the rest of the continent, with expanding impact globally. to do this, uct will build on its globally recognised expertise in natural and social science disciplines, as well as in the humanities. as the top research university in afrika, uct will move with ease between research focused on the building of new fundamental knowledge for the present and the future, and its targeted application for impact. we will value the role of cutting-edge next-generation knowledge. we will focus on solving complex problems and realising new opportunities within the social and natural world, by working collaboratively and democratically and using inter-, multi- and transdisciplinary approaches. uct will attract top academics from south afrika, the rest of afrika and the broader global community. the diversity of our staff, postdoctoral fellows and postgraduate students, and the integrated relationship between teaching, learning and research, will put uct at the global cutting edge of both research and postgraduate education rooted in afrika. uct will continue to build its research agenda on its existing strengths and areas of expertise, and its capacity to nurture new areas of strength selected to meet strategic priorities. we will actively focus on critical areas of impact in afrika – for example, climate change, biodiversity, urbanisation, migration, diseases of the poor, natural resource governance, and efficiency. we will extend our afrika-focused knowledge to a broader global reach. we will also bring an afrikan perspective to concepts brought in from the global stage, eg artificial intelligence and autonomous transport, and extend these for afrika’s impact and benefit while ensuring local relevance and thought leadership. we will focus on the recruitment of staff with a high level of expertise in key research areas. in the construction of this new research agenda, uct will intensify its global interface with other universities and research centres by leveraging our participation in international and afrikan partnerships, often leveraging these jointly. conscious of the priority and benefit of broadening our sources of knowledge and ways of thinking and doing, we will expand our orientation to embrace local knowledge and expertise and to position it effectively on the global knowledge stage. uct will forge strong social partnerships with local communities, civil society, business, and local and national governments, to shape its research agenda. in so doing, this research agenda will balance the aspirations of uct’s researchers, its funders and the society in which it functions. uct will build the technical and cultural infrastructure to develop strong collaborations 5.1 who do we want to be? 5.3 making it real 5.2 what the dream looks like15 that operate both digitally and face to face, as well as modes of thinking and doing research that balance the aspirations and needs of the university, the researchers, the funders and broader society. uct’s research infrastructure will create the organisational and material conditions to support its research excellence and relevance. development of inter-, multi- and transdisciplinary research projects and postgraduate programmes, grounded on strong disciplines, will grow through the provision of an environment that facilitates the exchange of ideas, concepts, approaches, knowledge and data. finally, uct will take the lead in the development of the next generation of researchers, scholars and beneficial leaders for the country and for the rest of the afrikan continent. to achieve all of this, uct will provide an integrated, responsive and well-governed infrastructure and enterprise research to support research, including ethic compliance infrastructure; cutting-edge online platforms to sustain virtual research collaborations; and relevant and accessible information resources, cross-institutional capabilities and infrastructure to support the shared management and use of data. uct will focus on the impact of its research and the extent of its social responsiveness, and will increase its ability to communicate research results and research impact publicly. as a cutting-edge hub for postgraduate education in afrika, uct will offer intense training for supervisors, on the understanding that supervision is a form of teaching that needs to be developed. further postgraduate education and early-career researchers will be supported through a strong researcher development academy.vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society concluding remarks to support this dream and make it sustainable, uct needs to take a number of important steps. first, it needs to continue to engage with the university community to elicit active participation in the new vision. second, it will require that the institutional and core function cascades are further translated downstream, creating an integrated dialogue across faculties, academic departments, support and professional services, and general administration. third, from an organisational point of view, uct will need to learn to hold together ambivalence and complexity. fourth, to be able to manage the complexity of our enterprise we will need to develop 21stcentury systems in the core functions, as well as in the administrative backbone of the university, from it to finance and human resources. fifth, uct will have to make fundamental decisions about where to allocate resources to make this vision sustainable. a vision such as this will require a different approach to the uct budget and the development of new and innovative ways to finance different elements of the strategy. we are looking forward to working with the uct council in achieving this.vision 2030 – unleash human potential for a fair and just society',\n",

we are committed to contributing to the development of society through research, education and innovation. university of copenhagen · strategy 2030 3 ambitions the strategy highlights three ambitions for the coming years where we particularly need to evolve: ucph wants to be the best place for the best ideas, be solution-oriented and innovative, and be a lifelong learning partner. these ambitions can be realised only through joint efforts across the university. the strategy encompasses the whole of ucph but will affect different parts of the university in different ways. sustainability, including economic, social and environmental sustainability, is so crucial to the progress of society and that of the university that it is a key component in the realisation of all three ambitions. we will push forward on all fronts to boost initiatives addressing, for example, climate change and the biodiversity crisis. the best place for the best ideas the university of copenhagen wants to be the best place for curiosity-driven research and for generating ideas with the potential to make major scientific breakthroughs. we will embrace bold ideas, unconventional experiments and innovative partnerships – challenged and tested by peers in accordance with scientific standards. the best research requires time for immersion, and we want to create possibilities for our researchers to work on the best ideas. often, the best ideas and new competence needs arise across existing disciplinary boundaries, and we will provide better opportunities for leveraging the breadth of our research for interdisciplinary breakthroughs and educational initiatives across disciplines. our students will experience engaging teaching and degree programmes that keep evolving under our guiding principles for education. university of copenhagen · strategy 2030 4 we set out to create favourable conditions for the individual’s development with a strong focus on core expertise and by providing opportunities for mobility and interdisciplinary collaboration. ucph wants to be recognised for an attractive study environment with high levels of student well-being and where students are part of communities and supported in their academic and social engagement through their education. we will ensure an attractive work environment, inspiring personal and professional development, innovation and quality in our

developing research partnerships with public and private foundations. this will ensure that external funding contributes to fostering new ideas and conducting independent, curiosity-driven and society-relevant research, education and innovation at the highest level across the university. an innovative and solution-oriented university the university of copenhagen will – together with partners – work to ensure that excellent research and talented students form the basis of innovation that helps develop new solutions to society’s challenges and create new jobs. ucph strives to become better at translating new knowledge and research-based ideas into sustainable solutions. we will support innovative teaching initiatives and practice that encourage solution-oriented thinking among our graduates. we will enhance the culture and framework conditions for innovation, entrepreneurship and business collaboration, and we will invest in and help develop a more coherent innovation ecosystem at the university, in copenhagen, the rest of denmark and in northern europe. our aim is to support researchers and students all the way from idea to business and to encourage partnerships with organisations, authorities and businesses. lifelong learning partner the university wants to respond to society’s growing need for skills development by being a lifelong learning partner for people and society. we will offer world-class research-based education at bachelor’s, master’s and phd levels and provide opportunities for continuing and further education throughout people’s careers. we will offer demand-driven and professional support for all our activities as a lifelong learning partner and design internationally attractive programmes that can extend the university’s multifaceted research to far more people than today. ucph will support a sustainable transformation by offering relevant competences and the latest knowledge. continuing and further education programmes will enable research and education to enrich each other through academic inspiration, pedagogical development and networking. we will offer a wide range of open university courses, and contribute to public democratic debate, the general education of society and people’s enthusiasm for science. prerequisites the university is situated in a world of constant cultural and societal change, and it requires constant attention to ensure that we live up to our role as a key stakeholder in society. accordingly, we will keep working to strengthen six prerequisites for the university’s general activities and for our efforts to deliver on the ambitions set out in the strategy. academic freedom universities have been entrusted with academic freedom to ensure the best conditions for generating and communicating new knowledge and to facilitate constant and critical discussion of existing knowledge, norms and practices. academic freedom applies to both research and teaching, and it is task for the leadership of the university to champion the responsible conduct of research. the university’s democratic culture and value creation must be encouraged through inclusion and participation. diversity, equity and inclusion a university should be characterised by creativity, curiosity and vision, which only comes about through allowing everyone at the university to contribute and participate, which will enhance the quality of research, education and innovation. diversity, equity and inclusion will be prioritised across all our activities. we aim to be an even more attractive place to study and work: a truly international institution where linguistic and cultural differences are valued. employees, researchers and students should feel welcome regardless of background, orientation or needs. university of copenhagen · strategy 2030 7 sustainable infrastructure and operations we are ambitious in our endeavours to become a more climate-friendly organisation. we have set overall objectives that address significant challenges in relation to climate footprint, resource use and biodiversity on campus. in the period covered by this strategy, we will translate these objectives into concrete actions and policies. the university will actively use the knowledge generated by our researchers and by the world around us to promote and support the green transition. we will create opportunities that make it easier for students and staff to work with the university’s green transition. global perspective the university of copenhagen aims to bring knowledge into play in international contexts and contribute to a better and more sustainable world. it creates value for research and education when the university’s researchers collaborate and publish with peers across borders and universities. we want to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best danish and international research and teaching talents to work at the university. we encourage student mobility, attract full-degree students, engage in international alliances and seek new partnerships with elite universities across the world. university of copenhagen · strategy 2030 8well-being, communities and good leadership our most important asset is talented staff and students who take responsibility for themselves and each other. the university will be known for prioritising well-being and job satisfaction and for fostering strong and committed ucph communities. good leadership is a key prerequisite for a good work/life balance for staff and students. our management must be professional, courageous and empathetic, and the conditions for management and leadership must be attractive. an integrated administration the university of copenhagen aims to have an integrated administration which, as an integral part of the university, contributes positively to discharging the university’s core activities. the administration must be seen as user-oriented and efficient with a high level of professionalism, excellent opportunities for personal and professional development and a shared service culture. creating benefit for more people – strategy 2030 ©

       " 'as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 2 our purpose & vision lse opened its doors in 1895 with three rooms and 200 students, the majority of whom studied part-time in evening classes. in 1919, william beveridge led a period of rapid intellectual and physical deve lopment for the school, and a century later lse looks very different. as we now share this strategy and vision for the future, we are building from a global reputation for excellence in teaching, research, and public engagement in the social sciences. we have a transformed campus, and 11,000 core residential students with 40,000 more through our extended programming. nonetheless, wide consultation with staff, students, alumni and friends of lse has confirmed an unequivocal ongoing commitment to the original vision for lse as: a community of people and ideas, founded to know the causes of things, for the betterment of society . as the world around us changes, we need to work harder than ever to help shape the world’s political, economic and social future for the better. lse’s brand is globally respected and a powerful draw for students, staff and partners. building on this, our vision for lse 2030 sets ourselves a challenging level of ambition in leveraging lse’s considerable expertise to ensure that - through our research, through the graduates we shape, and through our collaborations locally, nationally and globally - we are: the leading social science institution with the greatest global impact. our guiding principles excellence built from diversity and inclusion lse’s outstanding strength is the international diversity of its staff and students, drawing on talents and perspectives from all places and all backgrounds. all that we do will reflect the importance we place on equity, diversity and inclusion, ensuring that lse is a stimulating and supportive environm ent for work and study, and recognised as a place for serious debate where diverse viewpoints are respectfully but rigorously contested. higher education is experiencing unprecedented change in policy, regulation, funding and competition, whilst also needing to respond to political instability, changing labour markets and careers. in steering a course through turbulent times, lse will maintain a clear focus on quality rather than quantity. we will maintain our distinctiveness as a specialist and world-leading social sciences institution, striving always for excellence in both education and research, and robustly evaluating our own practices to ensure a culture of continuous improvement. we will broaden access to an lse education through an expanded programme of education and skills for life, including summer schools, executive education, blended and online opportunities, and will not seek to grow our resident student population above 12,000 full time students. faculty quality is key to delivering excellence in education and research. we will continue to invest time, effort and resources into recruiting, developing, supporting and retaining outstanding faculty from across the globe, and we will do so with a particular focus on diversifying the composition of our faculty. global impact and reach lse already has an exceptional international presence, with 70% of our students and 46% of our staff coming from over 200 countries outside the uk, an unrivalled global network of 145,000 alumni, over 1,500 institutional research collaborators and more than 3 million downloads of our research worldwide during 2017/18, more than any other russell group university. but we can, and we will, do more to enable wider access to an lse education, to reach further and inspire more people through our research, and to deliver meaningful benefit to individuals and communities in all parts of the world. ensuring a sustainable future the world faces unprecedented challenges to sustainable development, such as climate change, inequality, and political and social tensions. lse will continue to work tirelessly to address these challenges through research, education, public engagement and our own campus operations. lse has a proud history of defending intellectual freedom and upholding the standards of rigorous and informed debate. in this age where the value of higher education and experts in general is being called into question, and where opinions are being formed on the basis of rhetoric rather than evidence, lse will lead the way in upholding the rigorous standards of evidence-informed analysis and debate, and securing the future of social sciences. considerable uncertainty also surrounds the future economics of higher education, with constraints on core funding streams, rising costs and tougher competition for staff and students . our financial plan and funding principles together provide a robust and transparent framework within which we make informed choices about how we use our financial resources. through this framework, we will ensure a financially sustainable future for lse by broadening and expanding our educational offer and exploring new opportunities through research, entrepreneurship and digital innovation. philanthropy will be integral to our efforts, as it has been since our founding, and the visionary support and generosity of alumni and friends continues to enhance every aspect of lse life. as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 3 priority 1: lse education for global impact an lse education is valued for its intellectual rigour and global outlook. our students thrive in an international, research-rich culture, where excellence is built from diversity and respectful challenge. in a rapidly changing world, our educational offer must also evolve with frequently refreshed curriculum, varied modes of learning and assessment, and opportunities for our students to debate, innovate and create. as our first strategic priority, we commit to listening to student voices and feedback through student surveys, and working closely in partnership with students, to develop an educational offer for 2030 and beyond and ensure a more consistently excellent student experience. 1.1 education for 2030 and beyond lse students will have agency in their own learning, charting a personal trajectory through a diverse range of courses and assessments, while building a coherent, holistic picture of their disciplines(s). we will involve lse students with the school’s outstanding research culture, through embedding enquiry-based learning and research practice at all levels of the curriculum including through the effective application of cuttingedge digital technologies. we will enhance and expand the innovative lse 100 programme to enable lse undergraduates to work as critical investigators in interdisciplinary teams to tackle complex social questions. we will challenge lse students to develop their ethical awareness, to learn to persuade and not to silence, and to engage in robust but respectful debate with diverse views. we expect lse students to act with integrity and learn to reflect critically on their own biases. we will provide our faculty with the support and advice required to become and remain excellent educators and we will recognise, celebrate and reward excellence in education. 1.2 students as agents of change we will ensure lse students have opportunities to innovate and drive meaningful change within the school through the flagship lse change makers programme, delivered in partnership with lse students’ union. we will support lse students to create and produce diverse outputs, showcase their learning externally, develop skill in engaging with communities, and be recognised for what they contribute to the world even as they study. we will equip lse students to develop successful careers, graduating with the analytical skills, digital fluency, cultural awareness and entrepreneurial confidence to recognise opportunities and lead change for the betterment of society in their diverse communities and professions. 1.3 an inclusive student experience we will celebrate the exceptional diversity of our student community, and will ensure this diversity is reflected in a n inclusive curriculum that recognises a variety of perspectives, experiences and cultural norms. we will foster a strong sense of community and belonging by connecting students across cohorts and departments, through mentor schemes, peer study groups, student societies and events, and common rooms in every department, to ensure that all students feel that they are valued members of our scholarly community. we will provide holistic and comprehensive support for every student, with c onsistently excellent student services and a focus on student wellbeing. we particularly recognise the importance of a student’s early experiences at university for their long term success, and will curate a student-centred induction experience, including a place for every first year student in an lse residence. we will continue to build on our sector-leading efforts to widen access from across the uk as well as globally, to ensure the best students can benefit from an lse education at all levels, regardless of their means or background. we will significantly increase financial and other support for students and work in partnership with other institutions to better understand and effectively address systemic inequalities and differential attainment. 1.4 education and skills for life we will expand our educational offer to support our alumni and other professionals in refreshing and adapting their knowledge and skills as needed through evolving careers. whether taking the first steps after graduation, developing a career, leading a business or enjoying retirement, we will offer a continuum of ongoing learning opportunities in the form of short courses, summer schools and executive education programmes that enable our wider community to keep returning to lse - physically and remotely - throughout their lives. as approved by council, 5 feb 2019 4 priority 2: lse research for the world lse is unique in its dedication to the social sciences. the school has a reputation for being international, interdisciplinary, issue-oriented and pioneering in the development of new methodologies and disciplines , and our researchers are world-leading thinkers on critical issues, in keeping with our founding purpose of knowing the causes of things for the betterment of society. in ref 2014, 98% of lse research submitted across 14 units of assessment was judged to be world-leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). today the social sciences and evidence-informed expertise are needed more than ever to understand how the world is changing, and the effects of rapid technological developments, challenges to our economic and political systems, and social concerns such as ageing and wellbeing. as our second strategic priority, we commit to building on our research strengths to take a leading role in securing and shaping the future of social sciences, by robustly evaluating and articulating the value of our disciplines, developing the next generation of thought-leaders, deepening and broadening our real-world impact, and convening influential people across different sectors to tackle complex issues. 2.1 world-class research in the social sciences we will maintain our position as the leading specialist social sciences institution and continue to invest in a broad disciplinary base and vibrant research environment across and between all departments to enable diverse research activity. we will provide our faculty with the funding, support and career development guidance required to become and remain internationally renowned researchers who create

leadership message dear stanford community, in 2021 the ideal dei climate survey unearthed concerning aspects of our campus climate and culture. in response to the survey’s findings, the office of the vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community (vp-ieac) collaborated with various stakeholders including students, faculty, staff, and alumni to conceive and develop this strategic plan. the plan is rooted in an acknowledgment of the concerns unearthed in the climate survey and the pressing need to address them. this strategic plan embodies our commitment to establish an environment in which members of our campus community are afforded the opportunity to contribute to the university’s mission and, in doing so, are respected, can thrive professionally, and grow and develop personally. this is an institutional commitment — a stanford commitment — one that will transcend inevitable leadership changes over time. this plan also serves a secondary role. engagement with the community revealed a lack of clarity surrounding ideal which this plan will help remedy by providing a clear and comprehensive definition of ideal for our community. this will both garner support for this critical effort and equip our community to counter any misinterpretations of what ideal is and aims to accomplish. we recognize that there is still much ground to cover to create the campus climate and culture envisioned by ideal; however, we take pride in the measurable progress achieved thus far through the dedicated efforts of faculty, staff, and students. to learn more about accomplishments to date, please visit the ideal website. we look forward to collectively advancing the goals of ideal. sincerely, persis drell, provost patrick dunkley, vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community, and special advisor to the president “higher education has the mission to advance human welfare in a rapidly changing world. institutions that are truly inclusive and embrace and advance diversity everywhere – in every program, every school and every area of operation – will be the most successful. stanford must become one of those institutions! recognizing this, we must clearly articulate why diversity, equity and inclusion are important to us, how these values support the mission of the university, and what goals we have set to advance our commitment to them. ” -provost’s statement on diversity and inclusion academic freedom and ideal academic freedom is the very lifeblood of our institution. it is the principle that lies at the heart of our endeavor to continually ask new questions, explore new avenues of inquiry, consider new alternatives, and ultimately, develop new knowledge. academic freedom allows scholars to engage in open inquiry that can challenge systems, beliefs, and societal norms even when doing so is uncomfortable, unpopular, or controversial. and in an inclusive academic environment, there must be freedom to pursue and disseminate knowledge without fear of reprisal or censorship. in pursuit of academic freedom, it is critical to cultivate and sustain an environment that is welcoming to people of all backgrounds and all points of view. while there may be occasional tensions in an environment where both academic freedom and inclusion are respected, these values can complement one another. the simultaneous pursuit of academic freedom and inclusion is not only possible, it is integral to the goals of ideal and essential to stanford’s continual quest for excellence. the goals of ideal through ideal, we strive to ensure that a diversity of cultures, races and ethnicities, genders, political and religious beliefs, physical and learning differences, sexual orientations, and identities is thriving on our campus. below are the goals of ideal. page 3 page 4 page 5 definitions of frequently used terms key definitions inclusion, diversity, equity, and access are four short words used to encompass a set of substantive principles and practices aimed at effecting and sustaining environments where individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds 1) feel valued, respected, and supported; (2) can access opportunity regardless of their background or identity; and (3) can participate and contribute to the fullest extent. the following working definitions were developed with input from the community. inclusion is the practice of being intentional about involving and engaging with individuals of diverse identities or viewpoints, thereby giving voice to and valuing diverse perspectives. diversity refers to the representation of differences among individuals and groups in the broadest possible sense. these differences can be visible or invisible and include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, national origin, citizenship, caste, language, education, age, geography, family background, neurodiversity, religion, veteran status, ideology, experience, thinking, and communication styles. equity means working to ensure that there are no institutional or historical impediments that may prevent some individuals from having full access to the same opportunities, rewards, and resources as their peers. access means creating living, learning, and working environments that are free of physical, social, economic, psychological, technological, and cultural barriers to participation, and where all members of the university community can participate fully. learning environment refers to where and how we carry out the research and educational mission of the university.“our objective with this plan is to inspire our campus community to collectively effect transformative change. ideal will have greater impact if we merge our energies in pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive environment. ” patrick dunkley, jd vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community | special advisor to the president | executive director of ideal “we are the changemakers we seek. my hope is that we create a diverse and equitable ecosystem, one in which everyone can bring their whole, authentic selves to work and feel like they belong… where race (or any other social identity) will no longer be a factor in the assessment of merit, or the distribution of opportunity so that all faculty, staff and students can reach their full potential and truly thrive. ” shirley everett, edd, mba senior associate vice provost for residential & dining enterprises, and senior adviser to the provost on equity and inclusion. page 6 ideal strategic plan — introduction why is ideal important to stanford? inclusion, diversity, equity, and access in a learning environment ideal is a landmark effort of the university’s long-range vision announced in 2018. stanford’s vision includes the following four themes, and woven throughout these themes is a commitment to promoting the welfare of people everywhere: 1) sustaining life on earth, 2) accelerating solutions for humanity, 3) catalyzing discovery in every field, and 4) preparing citizens and leaders. at its core, a university is devoted to the discovery and transmission of knowledge. the enterprise cannot be limited in its methods and ways of thinking, or confined to experiences of one individual or subset of the community as a whole. to advance education, it is essential to be exposed to views and cultures other than one’s own and to have one’s opinions and assumptions discussed, debated, and challenged. such engagement expands our horizons, promotes intellectual breadth, and enables understanding across differences. recognizing this, we must clearly articulate why values such as embracing differences and ensuring equity of treatment are important to us, what goals we have set to advance our commitment to them, and the actions we will take to achieve these goals. the ideal initiative serves as the vehicle through which the university will do this. purpose of this strategic plan this strategic plan serves two main objectives. first, it acts as the means through which the university defines its vision and strategic direction for ideal in the context of the long-range vision. second, it represents the university’s comprehensive response to the findings of the 2021 ideal climate survey. the survey data revealed broad prevalence of experiences of negative behavior throughout the university community — and students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and staff have experienced these behaviors across every stanford school and in nearly every department and work unit represented in the data. we found that the culture experienced by members of our community did not meet our own expectations for a thriving community. this strategic plan’s ultimate aim is to serve as a “north star” that guides transformative change in our campus environment. the plan will achieve this goal by fostering alignment and collaborative efforts, university-wide, through ideal. it will advance initiatives that support the four institutional ideal goals that were formulated through extensive input from the university community.page 7 overview of campus climate baseline assessment the ideal climate survey in may 2021, stanford administered a diversity, equity, and inclusion survey as part of the ideal initiative. the survey was administered to all students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and staff and primarily focused on how one’s identity (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, etc.) shapes the experiences of community members at stanford. the survey included questions about demographic identities, experiences of inclusion and exclusion, and questions about experiences with harassing and discriminatory behaviors. ideal climate survey | response rates 8 36% overall response 8 14,907 respondents of 41,052 invited to take the survey 8 29-31% response rate for students, postdoctoral fellows, and clinician educators 8 comparatively high response rate among staff (44%) and faculty (38%) 8 response rate was higher for females (44%) than males (29%)* *note: currently, university records contain only biological sex. what we learned from the survey | harmful experiences and institutional dynamics the survey asked respondents about their experiences with microaggressions, verbal and physical harassing behaviors, and discriminatory behaviors. the survey report summarized the following major themes in respondents’ comments about the harmful interactions and institutional dynamics they experienced at stanford. 8 harmful interpersonal interactions and experiences 8 experiences of isolation and lack of voice 8 problematic university structures and destructive power dynamics 8 ineffective systems for reporting incidents, inconsistent or inadequate response, and the impact of harmful experiencespage 8 what we learned from the survey | scope and impact in addition to establishing a prevalence of these experiences, the survey data made clear the impact these types of interactions had on those that experienced them. overall, approximately one-third of the nearly 15,000 people who took the survey, regardless of race, gender, or role, indicated having faced significant impacts associated with personal experiences with microaggression, discriminatory behaviors, harassing behaviors. for the subset of survey respondents (on average, approximately 40%) experiencing at least one harmful behavior: 8 70% or more indicated at least one significant impact. 8 30% of respondents who experienced microaggression, 40% or more who experienced discriminatory behavior, and 60% who experienced harassing behavior indicated that they felt their experiences resulted in a hostile academic or work environment. 8 subsequent to their experiences, 29% felt uncomfortable voicing their opinion, 26% felt ostracized or excluded, and 24% avoided department/professional events. 8 23% seriously considered leaving stanford. in addition to highlighting the broad prevalence of these experiences at stanford, it is critical to emphasize that the impact of these negative experiences is not uniformly distributed across the stanford community, as demonstrated in the chart below: page 9 the path forward to inclusive excellence major themes | recommendations from the university community our path to inclusive excellence is grounded in the unwavering institutional commitment to promote the goals of ideal while never compromising excellence in our mission of research and education. it was with a firm understanding of this commitment that the 2021 ideal climate survey findings were enriched through dialogue with our community in a series of focus groups with students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, staff, and alumni in 2022. participants provided the recommendations below to address the survey’s findings: 8 increase diversity across all populations 8 improve communication about diversity, equity, and inclusion issues 8 improve reporting and accountability 8 improve support for people from marginalized identities 8 increase access to diversity, equity, and inclusion education opportunities 8 provide more centralized diversity, equity, and inclusion resources confronting the problem | intentional pursuit of systemic change given the broad prevalence of the negative behaviors represented in the survey data, the university must effect systemic climate and culture change. to achieve this goal, it must have a clear vision, strategic direction, and sustained institution-wide action through ideal. with this in mind, and with the provost’s statement on diversity and inclusion as a guide, the office of the vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community (vp ieac) worked with campus stakeholders to create this strategic plan as a mechanism for collective action. below is a summary of outcomes of this strategic plan.page 10ideal | stewarding collective action university-wide the ideal strategic plan signifies the transition of ideal from a set of university-sponsored initiatives to an umbrella framework that will guide work in support of inclusion, diversity, equity, and access across the university. through this transition, the university aims to align efforts across its multiple schools, units, and departments, scale successful practices, and promote a consistent message of inclusive excellence. as such, implementing this strategic plan will foster and sustain stronger alignment and collaboration between decentralized ideal staff and schools, units, and departments. through this unified approach, stanford aspires to cultivate and sustain a respectful environment that empowers every member of the university community to flourish and actively shape its future. ideal | institutional priorities and goals as part of the strategic planning process, the university identified actions needed to catalyze the pursuit of sustained institutional culture change. in outlining these actions, four priorities were identified and from these priorities four institutional goals were established. collectively, these priorities and goals are intended as an institutional “north star” that guides transformation. diversity: diversity is the representation and valuing of all our many identities and differences collectively and as individuals. equity: equity is a process of implementing systems that aim to eliminate disparities and improve opportunities for everyone. inclusion: inclusion is a set of intentional practices that enhance our culture and where each individual and group is respected, supported, valued and appreciated. belonging: in an environment that embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion, belonging is a state of being where everyone can find connection and feel page 11 page 12 priority 1: reinforce institutional commitment to ideal goal 1: reinforce stanford’s commitment to a respectful, inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible university environment while at all times upholding the fundamental principles of academic freedom, freedom of expression, and excellence. priority 2: shift the campus culture and climate goal 2: enhance the campus culture by facilitating an environment where members of the stanford community have a voice, are actively engaged, and experience a sense of belonging while interacting with the university’s living, learning, working, and research environments. priority 3: elevate equity and in-crease access goal 3: improve equity through policies, practices, and infrastructure that ensure members of our community have full and equitable access to resources, rewards, and opportunities. priority 4: increase diversity and representation goal 4: increase diversity and representation across the enterprise. identify gaps and use insights to broaden the diversity of students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and staff.page 13 ideal goals, objectives, and strategies structure of the ideal goals our institutional ideal goals serve as foundational cornerstones in this strategic plan. for each goal, we have identified several objectives that provide direction on what we want to achieve. these objectives, in turn, are supported by strategies that map out multiple approaches. finally, at the tactical level, we will implement actionable initiatives to bring the strategies to fruition in stanford’s schools, units, and departments and at the institutional level. collectively, the objectives and strategies in this plan form a framework through which to align ideal activities university-wide, but tailored to meet the unique contexts each of school, unit, and department. responsibility levels for strategies given the myriad available resources and operational approaches in the university’s decentralized environment, there is no expectation that any single entity will be able or need to implement every strategy recommended. however, when a school, unit, or department adopts a strategy, there must be a framework for identifying which entity is accountable for executing that strategy. as such, each strategy outlined in this plan has an assigned responsibility level (rl). below is an outline of the responsibility levels. • institutional (i): strategies listed as institution will be facilitated at the university level and organizations may be given the opportunity to collaborate, if desired. • school, unit, or department (s, u, d): strategies listed as school, unit, and/or department responsibilities could be facilitated at local levels, as each organization has available resources and goals that align. • individual (ind.): strategies listed as individual would be appropriate for individual community members to pursue. as an example: rl: i, s, u, d would imply that a strategy is appropriate to be implemented at the institution, school, unit, and/or department levels, while a strategy with rl: i should be coordinated at the university-wide level only. section 2: page 14 “the university made a commitment to use the 2021 dei survey results to inform our work going forward. this strategic plan was built on the findings of that survey and the ensuing dialogue with our campus community to gain their insights on institutional ideal goals. ” -patrick

climate survey and subsequent focus groups provided the quantitative and qualitative baseline data that facilitated the formation of priorities, goals, and objectives outlined in this strategic plan. below is an overview of the strategic planning process: 1. ideal climate survey: in may 2021, the ideal climate survey was conducted establishing a baseline for campus diversity, equity, and inclusion climate and culture. 2. synthesized survey findings: during the 2021-22 academic year, the university synthesized the data from the survey and released both the quantitative and qualitative results. 3. engagement with the stanford community: in the summer of 2022, the survey results were augmented through focus groups where community members provided input for the institutional ideal goal-setting process. 4. identified institutional priorities and goals: the ideal goal-setting committee, composed of ideal subject matter experts on inclusion, diversity, equity, and access from across the university, and including facu lty, reviewed the findings from the survey and themes synthesized from focus groups to identify strategic priorities and goals along with key objectives and strategies for achieving each goal. 5. drafted strategic plan: office of the vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community; senior advisor to the provost on equity and inclusion; office of diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging in university human resources; and ideal subject matter experts drafted the strategic plan. 6. sought strategic plan feedback, revisions, and approval: feedback on the draft plan was solicited from faculty, students, postdoctoral scholars, and staff with a variety of perspectives on inclusion, diversity, equity, and access. recommendations were evaluated and many were incorporated into the strategic plan before its review and approval by the president and provost. page 28 implementation overview strategic plan | implementation period and approach when translating a long-term strategic plan into action, dividing the journey into smaller stages results in greater success. this is our rationale for beginning with a five-year strategic plan followed by subsequent five-year cycles that leverage insights gained from each prior implementation phase. this approach allows for dynamic and iterative implementation based on empirical data. implementation | organizational readiness period to address the multifaceted challenges highlighted in the 2021 ideal climate survey, it is essential to prioritize preparation time at the institutional and local levels, where needed. as such, year one (ay23-24) will be earmarked for institutional readiness, as needed. this will enable the university to conduct needs assessments and, where appropriate, acquire and/or allocate resources for implementation activities, and to develop or adjust local-level strategic plans to align with ideal goals. implementation | challenges to be addressed community engagement revealed several fundamental institutional challenges that need to be addressed before the university can fully implement some of the objectives and/or strategies. these challenges are: • access to institutional data • uneven access to resources across organizations • lack of coordinated approaches informed by evidence-based research • inadequate institutional infrastructure to support ransformational change implementation | flexibility and autonomy for units the goals, objectives, and strategies in this plan constitute a flexible framework for schools, units, and departments to guide their local-level implementation efforts in support of the university’s overarching ideal goals. this means that there is the flexibility for each school, unit, and/or department to decide which of the objectives and strategies to prioritize for local implementation over the course of the first five-year cycle. this flexible approach allows for dynamic adaptation to local contexts, while maintaining alignment with institutional ideal goals. page 29 ideal strategic plan | implementation oversight the following teams will guide the overall implementation of this strategic plan. 1. ideal leadership team the existing ideal leadership team will provide guidance to the strategic plan implementation working group described below. this leadership team is composed of the provost, vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community, vice provost for academic affairs, vice provost for undergraduate education, vice provost for graduate education, vice provost for student affairs, vice provost for faculty development, diversity and engagement, vice president for human resources, dean of the graduate school of education, and representatives from university communications, and institutional research and decision support. the team will be provided with regular implementation updates from the working group and will be consulted on progress with the strategic plan implementation. 2. organizations with responsibility for core populations a. students and postdoctoral scholars: the office of the vice provost for graduate education (vpge), the office of the vice provost for undergraduate education (vpue), the office of the vice provost for student affairs (vpsa), and the office of postdoctoral affairs (opa) will oversee elements of this strategic plan that relate to student and postdoctoral scholar populations. b. faculty: the office of faculty development, diversity and engagement (ofdde) and faculty affairs (fa) will oversee elements of this strategic plan that relate to faculty. c. staff: university human resources and its office of diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging, and the senior advisor to the provost on equity and inclusion will oversee elements of this strategic plan that relate to staff populations. page 30 3. strategic plan implementation working group this working group is tasked with driving the implementation of strategies outlined in the strategic plan by coordinating with organizations responsible for implementation at the university level, defining and/or identifying practical and actionable tactics for local implementation, and documenting timelines for implementation and metrics and measures to drive accountability. this crossfunctional working group will be composed primarily of staff including ideal professionals (subject matter experts in inclusion, diversity, equity, and access). 4. stanford community engagement regular updates and opportunities for feedback will be provided to representative bodies (e.g., faculty senate, assu) as well as representatives from schools, units, and departments, and faculty, postdocs, and students to ensure a diversity of perspectives. 5. office of the vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community (vp-ieac) vp-ieac will facilitate the implementation of the ideal strategic plan in collaboration and consultation with each of the above groups. as the five-year strategic plan progresses, vp-ieac will maintain ongoing communication with school, unit, and department leaders to stay informed about the progress, obstacles, and achievements throughout the implementation process. page 31 markers of success framework a framework for analyzing progress in order to effectively gauge the impact and progress of the ideal strategic plan, it is crucial to establish clear markers of success. these markers will enable us to assess our achievements, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that the strategic plan translates into concrete and transformative outcomes. to advance this objective, in the coming months the strategic plan implementation working group will develop process and outcome metrics and markers of success, for the strategies prioritized for implementation. in the interim, at a high level, we will know we are succeeding when stanford thrives as an inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible institution that embraces the core values of academic freedom, freedom of expression, and inclusive excellence. our success will be evident by a community that reflects the diverse world we inhabit; a vibrant campus culture that empowers members of the community by ensuring their voices are heard; full and equitable access to resources, rewards, and opportunities; and a sense of belonging that becomes evident across all aspects of university life. below are some markers of success that will help us gauge the impact and progress of the ideal strategic plan. 8 transparency and communication: enhanced transparency and communication from university leadership around ideal initiatives, progress, and challenges. 8 freedom of expression: the campus environment encourages respectful dialogue, dissenting opinions are valued, and differing perspectives can be shared without fear of retribution. 8 partnerships and collaborations: establishment of partnerships and collaborations with external organizations, community groups, and other academic institutions to foster collective efforts toward advancing inclusion, diversity, equity, and access. 8 local level strategic planning: units conduct local strategic planning — identifying context-specific objectives that align with the ideal strategic plan, and they partner closely with the office of the vice provost for institutional equity, access, and community, the office of diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging in university human resources, the senior adviser to the provost on equity and inclusion, and subject matter experts on implementation. 8 infrastructure support systems to track and assess progress: implemented infrastructure to collect data and information on ideal initiatives and for tracking university-wide progress against the established markers of success. 8 measure and report on institutional progress: augmented accountability and periodic institutional progress updates are distributed to the university community during the strategic plan cycle. page 31 we would like to express our deepest gratitude to all stanford constituents who contributed to this

challenges. those challenges include the covid-19 pandemic, climate change, global divisions, and social inequality, as well as seemingly intractable problems such as the military invasion of ukraine by russia in february 2022 and the ongoing economic, political, and social turmoil around the world. because the conditions and assumptions that we have taken for granted are changing so drastically, those of us in academia must maintain a clear understanding of the mission of the university and possess a comprehensive vision that stretches from the past into the future as we continue to strive to create new knowledge. that understanding and vision are the foundation for utokyo compass, the statement of our university’s guiding principles that we announced in october 2021. as we declared then, the university of tokyo has been given a mission by society to nurture talented individuals who can actively tackle the profound challenges facing humanity. i have often emphasized the importance of reconnecting learning to society. today, with social frameworks changing rapidly, specialized learning in the classroom is not enough to create leaders who can raise original questions, integrate different kinds of knowledge, tackle diverse social issues, and work together with others to build a better future. that is why the university of tokyo focuses on providing our students with opportunities to engage directly with people throughout society and to gain knowledge through that experience. a key part of our efforts is support for entrepreneurship. conceiving and building new enterprises requires the ability to tackle problems persistently, come up with new ideas for solutions, and cooperate with others to make those ideas a reality. practicing entrepreneurship is also linked to the importance of “care,” which involves perceiving the various needs and wants that exist in society and responding to them appropriately. that is why the university of tokyo emphasizes education that reconnects learning with society. we encourage the younger generation, who will be responsible for the future of our society, to seek solutions to the global challenges that their generation will face, to serve the public interest through social entrepreneurship, and to launch startups that can play an active role on the world stage. the university of tokyo uses the term “management capacity” to describe our university’s ability to implement the initiatives necessary to achieve our mission of serving the public and strengthening the foundation for learning. the first step in boosting our management capacity has been to devise a new model for what a university like ours can be. as a national university corporation, the university of tokyo has been largely dependent on government funding, which comes with many conditions and restrictions. as leading universities in other countries have shown, universities can accomplish more when they also have sufficient funds to spend at their own discretion. one step to increase our discretionary resources has been to begin issuing university bonds. an excellent example of what an institution with sufficient financial independence can accomplish has been shown by oxford university. immediately after the genetic sequence for the wuhan virus was released in january 2020, oxford gave the go-ahead to develop a new vaccine. in collaboration with astrazeneca, its researchers succeeded in developing a vaccine that was soon released under a not-for-profit licensing agreement. that success clearly demonstrated the need for a university like ours to have autonomous funding and management. with our management capacity strengthened, our goal is to provide even greater value through our education and research and thus earn the recognition and support of society, creating a positive cycle of trust that leads to even more creative activities. in 2027, the university of tokyo will celebrate our 150th anniversary. we have many exciting actions planned in order to vigorously advance our “way” of being a university that serves the public good worldwide. this “utokyo way” was created to share what we have been doing with as many people as possible and to tell them about the future to which we aspire. after you have read it, we hope that you will engage in dialogue with us. we want to work together with you to create a more prosperous and sustainable society for the future that we all share. president’s message teruo fujii president the university of tokyo (utokyo) 11 utokyo way 2022-20231 president’s

in all of these activities, we emphasize dialogue among members of the university community and with the wider society. initiatives undertaken by the university have broad impacts on society and social capital. the proposals we make for a prosperous and hopeful future society seek to transform how society functions, as well as to contribute to the diversity of knowledge and to the solution of complex global issues. some examples of our initiatives are described beginning on page 14. by creating value and earning support from society through our activities, the university of tokyo both receives support from and gives back to society. as an institution committed to serving the global public, we will continue to promote this virtuous cycle in the years ahead. toward a prosperous and

for industryacademia collaboration, to discuss pathways and policies for japan to achieve decarbonization. the eti-cgc was announced on november 5, 2021, at the 26th conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (cop26) in glasgow, uk. since then, the eti-cgc has been discussing with leaders of participating companies, making extensive use of the university of tokyo’s academic knowledge and resources, on the topics of japan’s energy transition strategy toward decarbonization by 2050, and its closely associated 2050 future vision strategy, including the industrial structures and lifestyle changes. in november 2022, the cgc was also well received at cop27, held in egypt, where cgc representatives demonstrated crucial insights, including the need for renewable energy and hydrogen, through an interim analysis of the decarbonization scenario of japan’s 2050 energy system, and held discussions with participating companies and international leaders on the challenges and actions needed to achieve decarbonization. the cgc will continue research and practice to deal with the global issues facing humanity in collaboration with leaders from various areas across academic disciplines and businesses as well as beyond borders. taking on the challenge of global system change international achievements of the center for global commons fostering advanced human resources to lead green transformation (gx) practical application of global commons stewardship through collaboration with industry cgc director naoko ishii (far left) speaks at a cop27 event. global warming and the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems—the effects of which are becoming increasingly evident—are causing progressively greater difficulties for human society. drastically reducing the burden that we place on the environment and protecting earth system stability will require us to make fundamental changes in the major economic systems that govern our energy, food, production and consumption, and cities. the university of tokyo established the center for global commons (cgc) in 2020 to contribute to overcoming these challenges. ever since, the cgc has been working on and advocating a strategic framework and actions to transform the socio-economic systems necessary for protection of the global commons, together with various partners from business, finance, goverments, and international organizations. in 2021, the cgc—together with the un sustainable development solutions network (sdsn) and yale university—released the global commons stewardship in 2021, the university of tokyo launched spring gx, a program for doctoral students, with the aim of training personnel to lead the green transformation (gx) of society on a large scale in all fields. this program was adopted by the japan science and technology agency (jst) under the support for pioneering research initiated by next generation (spring) program. with 600 doctoral students—10% of those supported by this jst program—the university’s spring gx is the largest of the 59 spring projects. the project positions gx as a form of social transformation for better management of the global environment, an asset shared by all of humankind that must be passed on to future generations. it supports science and engineering departments that address science and technology-related fields as well as all other academic fields that relate to human activities, including legislation, philosophy, the humanities, and other social sciences. the program also provides financial support exceeding 2.5 million yen per student annually to enable each and index (gcsi: an index of each country’s environmental impact, both domestically and internationally), which clearly showed that consumption in developed countries is placing a particularly heavy burden on the planet. later, in may 2022, the cgc, systemiq (uk), the potsdam institute for climate impact research (germany), and the sdsn jointly released the global commons stewardship framework, which presents a practical scientific framework for responsible management of the global commons and which has been endorsed by many international organizations and international entrepreneurs. every student in the program to engage in challenging and emergent research, based on their curiosity. through a diverse array of options, including gx-related lectures and industry-academia collaboration internships, the program fosters highly transferable skills that are applicable in any industry or occupation in society. the research findings published by the cgc to date in cooperation with various international agencies and others are available in full on the cgc website. spring gx, the university of tokyo

the figure below maps for each research topic the top 1% in terms of impact based on citations and appearances in primarily english-language articles onto related fields of research. this demonstrates the level of excellence at the university of tokyo, where so much cutting-edge research is performed, and the diversity of its academic disciplines in english-language articles. a century and a half of diversity and excellence in learning and galaxies, and the origin of the planets. it is also hoped that the project will broadly help to train professionals and the next generation of leaders by including students in the development of cutting-edge science and technology. the university of tokyo also launched the collaborative research organizations system in 2016 to advance interdisciplinarity in various forms with support for interdisciplinary integration and cross-organizational activities. for instance, the collaborative research organization for historical materials on earthquakes and volcanoes was created jointly by the earthquake research institute and the historiographical institute. in this interdisciplinary research organization, historians and seismologists work together to advance the development of new research methods that integrate the humanities and sciences and to collect, compile, and analyze historical documents in an effort to build and publish a scientific database that can provide long-term information on seismic and volcanic activities in japan. it is hoped that the findings will not merely be shared with universities and research institutes nationwide but also prove useful for the long-term forecasting of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which would be invaluable for society. the mapping shows high-impact research topics (small inner circles) against the entire field of research (big outer circle). the closer to the center of the circle, the more interdisciplinary the research area is considered to be. additionally, looking at the size of each research topic based on the number of papers published, the university of tokyo is particularly strong in the fields of physics and astronomy, materials science, and molecular biology.

capabilities using satellite earth observation and satellite positioning and works internationally to train non-experts in how to make use of these methods. for example, by supporting the development of mapping tools and training programs that utilize the satellite positioning and communication functions of smartphones through the epinurse project in nepal, he has constructed a platform that enables nurses to easily share information on the health status of local residents and the medical assistance they need, thus helping the local nurses who use these tools to work more effectively. small-scale decentralized water supply systems have the potential to be more effective than large-scale centralized water services for people facing an urgent need to secure safe water, such as in developing countries with no water supply system, leaving residents with no choice but to use ground or river water suspected of contamination, in emerging countries where water supply services cannot keep up with the rapid pace of urbanization and population concentration, in depopulated villages where population decline makes it difficult to maintain and upgrade water supply facilities, and in evacuation centers and temporary housing during disasters. kumiko oguma (associate professor, graduate school of engineering) has developed a device equipped with a compact, mercury-free ultraviolet light-emitting diode (uv-led) that purifies water at the point of use, such as a faucet, and experiments to verify the device’s efficacy are under way in various locations. concurrently, she also conducts local surveys of water use and water quality in developing countries and works with local communities to understand their water purification equipment needs. she aims to provide safe drinking water to those left behind by conventional large-scale infrastructure water services and to reduce disparities in water access. resources of value creation ──people human resources tackling

pennsylvania and tsinghua university, while the university of tokyo has been represented by the sekisui house - kuma lab, where university professor kengo kuma and his colleagues serve as advisors and project lecturer toshiki hirano serves as director. the symposium provided an opportunity to present japan studio’s activities, reflect on how japan has contributed to the development of advanced architectural design thinking in international architectural education, and discuss future prospects. the worldwide spread of research and activity centers education and research hubs across japan beyond the main campuses the university of tokyo conducts research and educational activities at three campuses: the hongo campus (bunkyo city, tokyo), komaba campus (meguro city, tokyo), and kashiwa campus (kashiwa city, chiba prefecture). the university also makes use of other research hubs and training facilities where personnel engage in educational and research activities that are deeply rooted in the local regions and communities, located as far north as kitami city, hokkaido ( ★on map) and as far south as amami oshima island, kagoshima prefecture ( ★), which is registered as a world natural heritage site. these hubs and training centers cover a total area of approx. 32,600 ha, which is equivalent to 0.1% of all the land in japan. the university of tokyo forests, graduate school of agricultural and life sciences, which was established to provide a venue for forest-related education and research, account for most of this land area ( ● and ★). these university forests have been established in seven locations—chiba, hokkaido, chichibu, tanashi, aichi, fuji, and izu—and are used by the university as well as by a wide range of other domestic and international educational and research institutions as field sites for student training and a diverse range of research projects. these university forests are also expected to play a role in recharging water sources and absorbing

pioneering research and education, is to contribute to the future of japan and the world for the sake of future generations, and to extend those activities to the world. across the four regions of asia, latin america, north america, and europe, the university has established more than 30 research and activity centers in 15 countries (as of may 2022). the university of tokyo has opened overseas offices in five cities—new delhi, india; seoul, korea; colombo, sri lanka; dhaka, bangladesh; and new york, u.s.a.— to share information about the university’s education and research activities ( ●on map below). located in the heart of new york city, the utokyo ny office is especially well situated as a center of exchange among a diverse range of stakeholders, including alumni, international students, donors, and overseas research collaborators. it hosts various events and symposia to share the university of tokyo’s achievements in research and education and for donor activities. the

2022-2023value creationambidexterity is an approach to management that strives to balance meeting the needs of today with preparing for the challenges of tomorrow. for the university of tokyo, ambidexterity means balancing the utilization of knowledge through the strengthening of our existing operations with the exploration of new knowledge by expanding our horizons. we have adopted this ambidextrous approach so that we can be of even greater service to the world. as a national institution of higher education founded nearly 150 years ago, the university of tokyo has long sought to pursue research and education for contemporary applications while striving to explore new horizons. today, we are especially committed to providing solutions to complex global issues and developing new ideas for human society through dialogue and cooperation. we will continue through both endeavors to increase the social contributions of the university. however, we have been hindered by a lack both of discretionary funding and of a system for allocating funding within our organization on a flexible schedule. as a national university, the university of tokyo has been funded largely by the national government’s tax revenues. but now that the government’s finances have become strained, the university needs to secure additional funding to make up for the shortfall. that it has discretion over as liabilities in its accounts. the university uses those donations as funding for 44 billion yen in long-term investments, of which 11 billion yen is entrusted for investment in a portfolio with an expected return of 3.5%, which is anticipated to yield an investment return of 600 million yen annually. compared to the endowments of leading universities in other countries, however, the scale of those investments is still small and they are insufficient for strong management. the university is therefore urging the national government to amend the law to let utokyo establish its own endowment. this would enable us to plan the retention of funds other than public funding, treat those funds as equity capital, and utilize the investment returns and principal for up-front investments for the medium to long term. after the law has been amended, the portfolio may be revised toward investments with higher expected returns. by achieving a strategic, risk-balanced mix of flow-type funding that supports the basic operations of the university, including public funding and student tuition fees, debt-type funding such as university bonds and loans, and equity-type funding, we will achieve truly ambidextrous management with an ideal balance between utilization and exploration. graph 1. external funding conversion rate 1 usd = 136.40 jpy, ttm rate on march 1, 2023 apart from tuition fees and revenue from the university hospital, the university of tokyo has conventionally obtained external funding as donations and as funding for collaborative research with private companies. in recent years, we have also diversified our finances by issuing university bonds, becoming the first national university in japan to do so. as a result, the external funding of the university of tokyo has increased by an average of 12.6% per year over the past five years (graph 1). going forward, we will continue to add value to the intellectual assets of the university of tokyo in diverse ways, including large-scale collaborative industry-academia innovation (pp. 36–37), support for start-ups in exchange for stock options (p. 16 and later), and the provision of reskilling programs. this further expansion of external funding will enable the university to continue expanding its operations. figure 1 shows the funding cycle that enables the university to strategically accumulate funds and invest in a timely manner based on its own management decisions. at present, the university of tokyo requires approval from the national government to secure funds spanning multiple fiscal years, which inevitably leads to much uncertainty and to financial management biased toward single-year projects. to ensure continuity of operations, the university must record donations 207,368 285,667

of tokyo table 1 compares the financial standing of the university of tokyo with that of major universities in other countries. in terms of asset management, american universities clearly enjoy higher returns on investment, while for the university of tokyo investment assets account for a low percentage of total assets. instead, utokyo’s assets are dominated by real estate. while those assets include university forests and suburban research facilities (p. 23), the university’s main campuses at hongo, komaba, and shirokanedai are located in the tokyo metropolitan area, making real estate a much larger percentage of its overall assets compared to the other universities. since fy2020, the university of tokyo has issued two rounds of university bonds as social bonds. table 1 also shows the ratio of interest-bearing debt to ebitda, which is the measure preferred by rating companies (that is, cash flow excluding amortization and other items, calculated by adding interest income and depreciation expenses to ordinary profit and loss). whereas that ratio is 0.5 to 1.1 for other major universities, it is only 0.4 for the university of tokyo; this low debt ratio indicates that university bonds could be used more widely as a means of funding. new funding through issuing such bonds was made possible by a revision of government regulations, but restrictions remain, including use of the funds being limited to facilities and equipment. because a university produces value by creating something out of nothing in the form of intangible intellectual assets, utokyo is currently urging the national government to further relax the restrictions on the issuance of bonds. relaxed restrictions on the issuance of university bonds table 1. comparison of financial standing of the

issued “the university of tokyo statement on diversity & inclusion.” to achieve academic excellence, generate innovation in knowledge, and produce globally active professionals, it is critical that the university promote diversity and inclusion. in issuing the statement, the president engaged in dialogue and incorporated the voices of as many members as possible. the university of tokyo aims to be a magnetic, inclusive campus where anyone can study, work, and engage in activities with peace of mind. june 23, 2022 the university of tokyo statement on diversity & inclusion the university of tokyo has adopted this diversity & inclusion statement as guidance to all those involved in the university’s activities to encourage the creation of a fair and pluralistic society that respects and embraces diversity. through this statement, the university of tokyo reaffirms the principle of respect for diversity stated in the university’s charter while raising this principle to a new level. 1. respect for diversity constant dialogue among the diverse members of the university of tokyo community is essential to the university’s commitment to respect fundamental human rights and achieve academic excellence. the university of tokyo guarantees that no members of our community will be discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, language, religion, beliefs, political or other opinions, background, property, lineage or other social position, marital status, family relationships, lifestyle, disability, health status, career, etc. 2. promotion of inclusion the university of tokyo respects the spirit of inclusion and, in all of its activities, strives to reflect the diverse perspectives of its community. the university guarantees the opportunity for its diverse constituent members to participate in all of its activities, including decision-making processes, without being unreasonably excluded due to any attribute or background. the university also strives to ensure that not only its constituent members but all those who collaborate with the university are respected and are aware that they belong to a community that shares the principles of this statement. the university of tokyo should be governed independently and autonomously in accordance with the constitution of japan, which guarantees the freedom of education and research. at the same time, as an entity supported by the state with a public role to serve, it should also have a governance structure that is open to society and enables the university to fulfill its social responsibilities. the diagram below outlines the governance structure that enables the university to achieve all of the above. ・\\tthe president has ultimate responsibility for education and research. ・\\tthe board of directors, consisting of the president and nine executive vice presidents, makes decisions on important matters and affairs of the university. ・\\tthe executive vice presidents ensure that human resources are deployed in a way that is mindful of diversity and balances knowledge, experience, and ability so that individual roles and responsibilities are carried out effectively. ・\\tthe administrative council deliberates on important matters of governance. the majority of its members are appointed from outside the university and reflect a diverse range of perspectives. ・\\tthe education and research council deliberates on important matters of education and research. as a forum that contributes to education and research-related decisions by the president through exchanges of opinion between the president and vice presidents on the one hand and department chairs and faculty representatives on the other, the council embodies the principle of academic freedom. additionally, the university of tokyo has numerous other places for dialogue, such as the utokyo global navigation board, that give voice to a diverse range of opinions. figure 1. “the university of tokyo statement on diversity & inclusion” leaflet figure 2. numerical targets and trends target values 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 ʢ%ʣ 201720162015

global warming. with that in mind, in 1994 the university of tokyo launched the alliance for global sustainability (ags) in partnership with the massachusetts institute of technology (mit, usa) and eidgenössische technische hochschule zürich (eth zürich, switzerland) as an international inter-university academic collaboration focused on maintaining a sustainable anthroposphere. this was the world’s first sustainabilityrelated initiative by universities. in 1998, the graduate school of frontier sciences was established with one focus being on environmental studies. achieving net-zero carbon through educational and research outcomes the university of tokyo is one of japan’s leading universities, but it also emits significant amounts of carbon dioxide. in october 2021, we became the first japanese national university to join the international race to zero campaign launched by the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), and in october of this year, we developed an action plan, utokyo climate action, to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. the plan calculates ghg emissions for scopes 1, 2, and 3 and sets reduction targets for each scope to be achieved by 2030, 2040, and 2050 (table 1). in 2005, the integrated research system for sustainability science (ir3s) (reorganized in 2019 as the institute for future initiatives) was launched. in 2008, the sustainable campus project (tscp), which continues to this day, was begun with the aim of creating a sustainable campus. and in 2021, after teruo fujii became utokyo’s president, green transformation, or gx, was made a major pillar of utokyo compass. as all this shows, the university of tokyo, as a global research university, has long been addressing climate change issues through its research, education, and administration. figure 1. sustainability initiatives table 1. utokyo reduction targets by scope and phase figure 2. utokyo scope 1,2,3 ghg calculation

its goals and thereby promotes behavioral change, then society may change and the emissions of ordinary households and society as a whole may change significantly as well. the university of tokyo promotes the transformation towards a greener economy and the revitalization of society through research results and the production of human resources. this is the gx that we are aiming for. we hereby pledge that all faculty, staff, and students will work together to promote gx. scope 1 includes direct emissions such as those from on-campus fuel use. scope 2 includes indirect emissions associated with the purchase of energy. scope 3 includes various other emissions, such as those from the production of goods, services, capital goods, etc., that the university purchases, emissions related to transportation outsourced to other operators, and emissions related to commuting and business travel by faculty and staff. when scope 3 emissions were calculated separately for each of the 15 categories, scope 3-1 and scope 3-2 were found to be especially large (figure 2). as there are still very few universities in the world that have gone so far as to include scope 3 in their calculations, this is a cutting-edge effort. utokyo climate action aims to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. on the other hand, our latest calculations revealed surprising environmental impacts resulting from processes induced by the purchase of goods, such as mining of raw materials, manufacturing of products, and transportation that are indirect greenhouse gas emissions through everyday activities at the university. achieving the goals will not be easy. to be sure, eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by the university alone will not make a significant

another earth, the “digital earth,” where memories of war and records of disaster have the power to jolt viewers with the realization that “behind the data, there are people” and bridge the temporal and spatial gap between them and us. “on a small computer screen, it tends to feel like a game and lacks a sense of reality. when you see it at this size, you feel like events are happening right before your eyes,” says professor hidenori watanabe of the interfaculty initiative in information studies and the graduate school of interdisciplinary information studies, as he explains the significance of representing digital archives visually on a large screen, which he likens to a “work of art.” the objects preserved in digital archives can vary widely, ranging from museum and library collections, to tangible and intangible culture properties, to industrial resources. the purpose of a digital archive is to preserve and store that information so that database technology and other such tools can be used with it. professor watanabe has introduced the concept of multi-dimensional digital archives. this approach deepens our understanding by working in collaboration with a diverse range of people across borders and generations to take previously scattered digital archives and combine them on digital earth. a product of this approach is the digital archive series (figure 2), which collects and preserves on digital earth the testimonies of hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bomb professor masahiko inami of the research center for advanced science and technology has proposed the concept of jizai (i.e., people’s ability to intuitively take the actions they wish), which stands both in contrast to and parallel with the concept of automation, in which machines perform tasks that humans do not wish to, and he continues to conduct research aimed at enhancing human capabilities through the use of various technologies. professor inami refers to the technology and research field of enhancing human capabilities to achieve this state of jizai as “enhancing human i/o,” and he is working to develop a variety of devices for these purposes. as an example, fusion, which makes use of robotic arms operated remotely via vr, enables people in separate locations to share the same perspective to work in tandem or even to teach a musical instrument or a sport by holding the wrists of the learner to guide their movements from afar. everyone who experiences these human augmentation technologies remote operation enables two people in separate locations to share the same perspective and work in tandem. it is also a communication medium that increases empathy between the participants.

activities involving digital technology in an effort to accurately record the extent of damage and to support reconstruction efforts, including the rebooting memories project, in which blackand-white photos are colorized through a collaboration between people and ai to vividly revive memories of the past, and a 3d model mapping project that shares the current state of wars and disasters occurring now through a collaboration involving people around the world connected via the internet. constructed in virtual space in collaboration with a diverse range of people across borders and generations, this ever-evolving “archive of memory” will serve to connect people in spirit and lead to a better future. seems to be delighted by the new things they can do, even if they are accomplishing them through a “new body.” by enhancing the capabilities of our body with these devices such that they feel like an extension of our own body rather than mere tools, we are able to learn more about our body’s functions and explore its limitations. professor inami aims to establish the science of body informatics by modeling the relationship between this new form of physicality and the brain that controls it using an informatics-based approach. when asked about the significance of his research, professor inami explains, “through the power of technology, we can accomplish today that which was impossible yesterday, and may become able tomorrow to accomplish that which is impossible today. if we believe in this, then we can remain positive about the future.” he continues to conduct research aimed at achieving physical jizai, which will surely lead to the future pursuit of mental jizai. figure 1. professor watanabe explains the digital archive displayed on liquid galaxy. he hopes that people will view the archive not alone, but with others, and share their impressions with each other. figure 2. hiroshima archive hiroshima in 1945, as re-created on digital earth. the atomic blast is

energy, 90% less greenhouse gases and water, and 1/100th the amount of land compared to beef. solving the food crisis production will be possible independent of climate change. also, because it can be produced and consumed locally without relying on imports, it is advantageous in terms of food security. safety because it can be produced under sterile conditions, there is less risk of contamination by e. coli and other bacteria, which may make it possible for it to be consumed raw or even stored at room temperature. likewise, there is no need to worry about zoonotic diseases like avian influenza or the problem of resistant bacteria, which result from antibiotics administered to livestock to prevent such diseases. solving food waste worldwide, the beef equivalent of nearly 75 million head of cattle gets thrown away each year without being eaten. it takes two to three years to raise a cow, whereas cultured meat can be produced in just one to two months, making it easier to control production in response to changing social conditions or other factors. animal welfare livestock production currently contends with issues that include the loss of animal life and methods of raising livestock that do not consider animal comfort. cultured meat can be produced from a small quantity of cells, thus reducing the number of animals that are sacrificed for meat. research to produce sustainable yet delicious “cultured steak” how to govern ai by multi-stakeholders? while artificial intelligence (ai) has made our lives more convenient, it has also reproduced the discrimination and prejudice found in society, for example, when a black man was mistakenly identified by a facial recognition system and falsely arrested, or when a job-recruitment ai caused a stir by rating women lower and its development was suspended. arisa ema, an associate professor at the institute for future initiatives who was included among the 100 brilliant women in ai ethics* in 2019 and 2020, believes that such problems can be solved by including people with diverse perspectives at the early stages of ai development in discussions to overcome unconscious bias. as a tool to promote stakeholder dialogue, associate professor ema’s research group, the technology governance research unit, ai governance project, has developed a “risk chain (rc) model.” for each of the possible risk scenarios, the model proposes a risk chain (relation of risk factors) and steps to be taken by each party (ai system developers, service providers, and users) to control risks. rcmodel is currently featured in 11 case studies, including recruitment ai, unstaffed convenience stores, and cancer diagnostic ai. to ensure the reliability and transparency of ai-based services, it is important that not only system developers but also service providers and users consider the values they want to promote in society, the potential risks, and how to minimize those risks. the rcmodel is freely available for anyone to use under a creative commons license on the institute for future initiatives website. *women in ai ethics (waie), a global initiative with a mission to increase recognition, representation, and empowerment of women in ai ethics, annually selects 100 women who are active in the world of ai ethics. figure 1. example of rcmodel this model evaluates the risk of bias based on

holdings, professor takeuchi succeeded in 2019, for the first time anywhere in the world, in producing cultured meat in cubed steak form (1×0.8×0.7 cm, weighing about 1 gram) using beef-derived muscle cells. unfortunately, because it was made using research-grade material (pharmaceuticals), the taste and texture could only be analyzed using instruments. now, with the successful creation of cultured meat that can be eaten, it will be possible to actually eat the cultured meat and evaluate its taste and texture, and this is expected to promote further research. the research group aims to fully develop technology to create 100 g cultured steak meat by the year 2025. in the not-too-distant future, cultured steaks as thick and delicious as real beef may be on our dinner tables. in march 2022, professor shoji takeuchi of the graduate school of information science and technology and a research group from nissin foods holdings co., ltd., succeeded in producing edible cultured meat, a first for collaborative industry-academia research on cultured meat in japan. while global meat consumption is expected to increase due to population growth and people’s changing lifestyles, there are also growing concerns about meat shortages and the environmental impact of livestock production. this has been fueling interest in cultured meat as a new meat option. made by cultivating livestock cells in vitro, cultured meat can be produced with less space and fewer resources than raising livestock, and could thus help resolve various global issues, including environmental protection and a stable food supply. while cultured ground meat is already available, the production of thick, steak-like meat requires more advanced rcmodel 36 37 utokyo way 2022-2023 utokyo way 2022-20233 action for the future

graduate school of information science and technology, the ibm-utokyo lab trains quantum “natives” for quantum computerrelated technologies in three stages, including the komaba campus (liberal arts education), department of physics, faculty of science (upper-division undergraduate program), and information science and technology (master’s program). in ay2022, the second year of the program, there were 161 new students who embraced the challenge of practical quantum computing using ibm quantum. there are now more than 320 quantum natives who transcend the divide between the humanities and the sciences, and their numbers will only continue to grow. quantum technology strategy of the university of tokyo ibm quantum system one at kbic in kawasaki city in 2021, the university of tokyo and ibm opened the university of tokyo-ibm quantum hardware test center on the asano campus of the university of tokyo to research and develop quantum computing technology. the test center is equipped with a quantum computer system testbed for evaluating components to be used in future large-scale quantum computers. the same year, japan’s first gate-based commercial quantum computing system, ibm quantum system one, for which the university of tokyo has exclusive use rights, began operation at a dedicated facility in kanagawa prefecture. together with companies participating in the quantum innovation initiative consortium established in 2020, the university has been using system one to promote practical applications of quantum computing in society. at the same time, the utokyo-ibm quantum collaboration center was created on the hongo campus. engineers from ibm are directly involved with the collaboration center and actively exchange information with researchers from the university and qii members about the software, algorithms, and other technology needed to utilize system one. these three hardware and software initiatives are based on the japan-ibm quantum partnership that was signed between ibm and the university of tokyo in december 2019. under this partnership, which allows the broad participation of other universities, public research institutions, and industry, the university of tokyo serves as a gateway that contributes to solving issues in japanese society through the research, development, and utilization of quantum computers. the challenge of applying quantum computing in society: the university of tokyo-ibm gateway initiative the japan-ibm quantum partnership, an initiative involving japanese industry, academic institutions, and research institutes, aims to make japan a leader in the actual use cases of quantum computing through strategic research and development at the ibm-utokyo lab (established june 2020). “what will the future look like once quantum computing has practical applications? we imagine how society will look, share that vision with stakeholders, and work backwards to decide what needs to be done right now. what makes this possible is collaborative, ‘organization-to-organization’ industry-academic innovation,” explains ibm-utokyo lab’s enthusiastic director, professor masaki kawasaki. exclusive use rights to system one mean far more “machine time” (the amount of time that the quantum computers can be used for computing), and the accelerated response means that research findings are published much faster. additionally, the five-qubit machine installed at the test center, ibm quantum, is exceptionally stable and makes it possible to test peripheral systems and component materials that help to enhance capabilities of quantum computers, raising hopes for breakthroughs in pioneering the future with two quantum computers and collaborative industry-academia innovation at the ibm-utokyo lab

her prince column the curse placed upon the beautiful aurora was terrifying. cast into a deep sleep upon her 16th birthday, she is awoken from her slumber by a kiss from the prince. this ancient european fairy tale, “sleeping beauty,” closely reflects certain characteristics of research. specifically, it captures the varied timeframes by which the knowledge produced by research is eventually put to use in society. professor ichiro sakata of the school of engineering, who is also a data science expert, and his team performed a network analysis on 70 million scholarly articles and 1.2 billion citations (connections) in scopus to understand the relationship between a “sleeping beauty” and her “prince.” according to professor sakata and his colleagues, there is not necessarily a correlation between a paper’s orthometrics (a measure that assesses a scholarly article’s social impact), i.e., how frequently a paper is mentioned on social media, and its citations (a measure of the number of times a scholarly article is cited). but they also report many cases in which emergent research that failed to garner the academic community’s attention for many years (a sleeping beauty) suddenly has its break-out moment when it appears in a prince of an article. long ago, there was mendelian genetics. or the case of biologist osamu shimomura, whose discovery of green fluorescent protein went unnoticed for many years before two researchers in the u.s. played the role of the prince by calling attention to his work, resulting in all three sharing the nobel prize in chemistry in 2008. although princess aurora slept for 100 years, this research suggests that such scholarship lies dormant in the dark for an average of 30 years before having a sizable impact on society. and, from among the 70 million scholarly articles examined, the number of such miraculous matches between a sleeping beauty and her prince was reported to be more than 30,000. temporal variation has always characterized science, but the timeframe of the value it creates is itself varied and fuzzy, too. at the university of tokyo, an abundance of research lies asleep and waiting for a miraculous encounter with its prince. we hope this story conveys that the number of citations of an article is not the only way to measure the value of research, and that there remain many studies yet to grow and flower from this diverse seedbed. original paper t. miura, k. asatani, i. sakata, “large-scale analysis of delayed recognition using sleeping beauty and the prince,” applied network science 6(1)

hida city, gifu prefecture ( ★on the map on p. 23), is a large-scale observation detector that will serve as the successor to the kamiokande and super-kamiokande, which have produced two nobel prize laureates. this research project goes back to 1983 when the first kamiokande started observations, which resulted in the detection of neutrinos from a supernova explosion. subsequently, super-kamiokande started in 1996, leading to the discovery that neutrinos oscillate. although these achievements greatly advanced humanity’s understanding of the properties of neutrinos, the number of topics that need to be investigated has continued to rise. this led to the decision to construct the hyper-kamiokande for far more precise measurements of neutrinos and other elementary particles with much higher statistics. the hyper-kamiokande is the first of its kind in the world—a 70-meter-tall subterranean cavity that will observe elementary particles and neutrinos using an ultra-large tank equipped with ultra-sensitive optical sensors, with an effective volume 10 times greater than that of superkamiokande. the purpose of the facility is to unravel the mysteries of elementary particles and the nature of the universe through discoveries relating to proton decay and violations of cp-symmetry, as well as through observations of neutrinos from supernova explosions. construction continues under this international project involving more than 500 researchers from around the world, and observations are scheduled to begin in 2027. professor masato shiozawa, director of the kamioka observatory, explains the project’s significance within the context of basic research as follows: “this research aims to shed light on the fundamental science of how the universe was formed 13.8 billion years ago and how the world as we know it came to be. in proceeding with the project, we recognize that this knowledge is an asset not only for japan but also humanity as a whole.” in addition, since the development of cutting-edge observation equipment requires the creation of many new devices, students are able to study physics together with a wide range of other engineering-related subjects. these huge experimental projects also provide opportunities to train the personnel that society needs and to foster the next generation. the project team has been working to overcome the many difficulties and technical challenges it has faced along the way as it seeks to open up new horizons of knowledge.the graduate school of humanities and sociology has entered into a regional cooperation agreement with shingu city, a core city in the kumano region of wakayama prefecture, which has also been registered as a world heritage site, in an attempt to contribute to the promotion of local culture through the application and utilization of the humanities. many regions in japan are rich in culture and natural environment, yet face problems such as low birthrates, aging populations, and depopulation. the graduate school of humanities and sociology aims to contribute to the promotion of culture through focused application of the wisdom of the humanities to identify the humanities-related issues common among such regions. with the cooperation of shingu city, wakayama prefecture ( ★\\ton map on p. 23), the university of tokyo has been operating a hands-on activity since 2017 to provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to learn more about the culture and administration of shingu city, while experiencing the history, culture, and natural environment of kumano, which is regarded as a sacred site. professor akira akiyama (an art historian) of the graduate school of humanities and sociology, who has been involved in this program since the planning stage, explained that the sacred sites of kumano, registered as a world heritage site, provide an endless treasure trove of research topics for those studying the humanities. he further explained that, for the university of tokyo, which aspires to be “a university that anyone in the world would want to join,” there is much to learn from kumano, a region that has welcomed and accepted people of all walks of life regardless of religion, gender, or status for more than 1,200 years. he added that students who have participated in the program have—through their experiences in kumano— come to view their own values in a more relative sense, leading to deeper observations and reflections. in this program, students actually walk the kumano pilgrimage route guided by a local religious folklore researcher, listen to lectures given by the head priests of local shrines and temples, and participate in discussions with the mayor and other local residents involved in the administration of this regional core city. each year, the participants include students from the faculty of letters hands-on activity in sacred kumano, a world heritage site and the graduate school of humanities and sociology, as well as other undergraduate and graduate students studying a variety of different specialized fields in both the humanities and the sciences. the program provides students with opportunities to develop both physical and mental strength, which are difficult to attain in a more urban setting. students visiting kamikura shrine in shingu city, which was built to worship a giant sacred stone, as part of the hands-on activity. the mifune matsuri, an annual festival at kumano hayatama taisha shrine, has also been designated by the government as an important intangible folk cultural property. this ancient ceremony re-enacts the arrival of the kumano deities from kamikura to the land of hayatama, and is renowned as the best boat festival in the kinan region. initiatives for regional collaboration by the graduate school of humanities and sociology 45 utokyo way 2022-20233 action for the futurecollaboration between shingu city and the graduate school of humanities and sociology and the faculty of letters, set in motion by this hands-on activity, has since developed into holding the kumano forum to highlight the characteristics of kumano as a sacred site through mutual comparison with sacred sites in other regions and countries, as well as hands-on opportunities for international students and other participants. in march 2021, shingu city and the graduate school of humanities and sociology and the faculty of letters officially entered into a partnership agreement. the purpose of the agreement is to collaborate in efforts to develop research on the kumano region, to utilize such research to promote regional development as well as international communication and exchange, to provide domestic and international students with opportunities for hands-on experience and training, to revitalize the kumano region through social education on the region, and to research and preserve cultural assets. in appreciation of the benefits of collaboration, michitoshi taoka, mayor of shingu city, commented that the university of tokyo’s activities in shingu city will likely generate ripple effects that go beyond the scope of academia, culture, and education. shigeyasu hayami, superintendent of the shingu city board of education, who has been energetically involved in education as well as the preservation and utilization of the world heritage site, also expressed high hopes for the collaboration. he keenly feels that the universal value of the sacred sites of kumano, a world heritage site of which local residents are largely unaware, is being redefined through the genuine academic achievements of the university of tokyo, and he expressed his desire for this to continue into the future. under this agreement, in november 2021, the kumano project shingu branch office was established in a section of a composite cultural facility within the city, partnership agreement between shingu city and the graduate school of humanities and sociology and the faculty of letters where a researcher affiliated with the graduate school of humanities and sociology is stationed on a seasonal basis. assistant professor izumi florence ota (specialized in art history), who spent about four months since then conducting research in shingu city, commented on the wonderful experience she gained as a researcher by sharing information in an easy-to-understand way on her research in the humanities while living in the region and communicating with the local people. she also actively promoted regional collaborative activities, such as starting a new outreach activity in which faculty members from the university of tokyo introduce their research in the form of lectures, broadening their target audience to include local junior high and high school students in order to introduce them to the fascinating world of the humanities. in addition, in november 2022, the university of tokyo entered into a comprehensive partnership agreement with wakayama prefecture, where kumano and mt. koya are located. following mie prefecture and fukushima prefecture, this marks the third such partnership with a prefectural-level municipality. under this partnership, the graduate school of humanities and sociology, the research center for advanced science and technology, the institute of industrial science, and other participants will promote academic research to solve regional issues as well as personnel exchanges through field studies and other collaborative initiatives in which university of tokyo students reside in the prefecture for a certain period of time. kumano hongu taisha kumano hayatama taisha the oto matsuri, held annually at kamikura shrine, has also been designated by the government as an important intangible folk cultural property. this festival signifies the renewal of fire at the beginning of the year, and the ritual represents purified fire being bestowed upon the people. the reverse side of the agreement signed with shingu city is decorated with a protective talisman unique to the three main shrines of the kumano region. kumano (the area surrounding ★on the map on p. 23), located in the southern part of the kii peninsula, the largest peninsula in japan, which juts out southward from the center of honshu into the pacific ocean, is a region blessed with a rich and varied natural environment comprised of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and the sea. in the past, kumano was considered the gateway to the buddhist pure land, attracting so many people on pilgrimages to the area in search of salvation that they were metaphorically likened to rows of marching ants. the kumano kodo road connects the three main shrines of the kumano region in wakayama prefecture: kumano hongu taisha shrine (tanabe city), kumano hayatama taisha shrine (shingu city), and kumano-nachi taisha shrine (nachikatsuura town, higashimuro district). this road was registered as a unesco world heritage site in july 2004 under the title “sacred sites and pilgrimage routes in the kii mountain range,” along with the omine okugakemichi road, which connects kongobuji temple on mt. koya, kinpusenji temple and kinpu shrine in the yoshino and omine area, and ominesanji temple. in the process of being registered as a world heritage site, the region was especially highly praised for its cultural landscape, which developed through interactions between humanity and nature. in terms of notable universal value, the region was recognized as follows: “the monuments and ruins that form the cultural landscape of the kii mountain range are unique products of the fusion of shintoism and buddhism, and are good examples of the exchange and development of religious cultures in east asia.”
